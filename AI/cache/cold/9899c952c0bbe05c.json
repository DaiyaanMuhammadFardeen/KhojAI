This was a landmark movie, cementing skills from all areas of Hollywood, from the budding special effects industry, to the acting skills of Bob Hoskins, to the SUPERB directing skills of Robert Zemeckis, to create one of the most impressive movies in Hollywood. While this movie was not the first of it's kind, it was definitely the first to have cartoons and real actors interact so seamlessly, and it is impressive that it was made over 15 years ago. Another impressive part of this movie is the soundtrack, using the classic 20's jazz song \"Why Don't You Do Right?\" to bring back the old jazz club scene, to make for a truly authentic feel from a cartoon character, as well as the detective music used all originally composed. All around, this movie is one that I Grew up with, and children and adults will be enjoying for decades to come, because Who Framed Roger Rabbit will be a classic in the movie world for a long long time. technical marvel and a great comedy Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the zaniest and smartest movies to come out in a long time.Directed by Robert Zemeckis who later did Forrest Gump and Castaway among others, it stars Bob Hoskins as a washed up private eye in the 50s who gets dragged into a murder investigation in Toonland to help unravel a mystery and prove the innocence of a toon Roger Rabbit. One of the real treats of the movie is Kathleen Turner who does the voice of Jessica Rabbit.She is a perfect choice with that sexy sultry voice. The movie is great fun for the whole family.there is a little innuendo but like Jessica says.\"I'm not bad.I'm just drawn that way\" A real treat! Holds the record for most credits at the end of a movie (937!) On a scale of one to ten. 9 One of the real treats of the movie is Kathleen Turner who does the voice of Jessica Rabbit.She is a perfect choice with that sexy sultry voice. 9 Entertaining movie I watched this movie again many years later and it is still just as entertaining. The only strange thing is to see characters from Disney and Warner together, today it would be impossible. The Best Film Produced in 1988 \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" appears to be a film for the kiddies on first glance, but this is a somewhat complicated murder mystery that never gets old or dull. The animated title character has been framed and now he is out to clear his name with the help of a human detective (Bob Hoskins). Robert Zemeckis cemented his ability to make a film with this winner. The special effects, which are remarkable, never detract from the story and in the end they add a great dimension to this fine motion picture. Overlooked in 1988, but the best film from that weak year. A unique movie experience \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is a wonder in the art of making films. Because it mixes live-action and cartoons, it was a challenge to be made. But that's exactly what makes it so distinguish and unique, especially considering that the idea works out so well. It's a different and original movie experience, a real winner. Yet, the film is more than a combination of live-action and cartoons. It has a dark atmosphere with lots of suspense, almost like a thriller. Classic humor isn't forgotten either, with numerous funny lines and hysterical gags, as well as humorous characters. The joke about uncle Thumper is one of the funniest, but there are many others. There's also a hilarious piano acting with Donald Duck and Daffy Duck, which they play the same piano song as in Tom & Jerry's short \"The Cat Concerto\" and have their hilariously silly battle. In fact, the soundtrack of the movie is excellent, including Jessica Rabbit's song \"Why don't you do right?\" and a suspense music very similar to one from the original \"Back to the Future\". Other movies that successfully mix live-action and cartoons are \"Mary Poppins\", \"Pete's Dragon\" and \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\". Like \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", those three movies combine this \"marriage\" very well. On the other hand, other movies such as \"Space Jam\" tried this idea but without the same success. I believe that this movie was made in a unique moment of inspiration. The sceneries are great, the designs, the cartoons, the backgrounds, the details, the animation, the special effects, the artwork. everything was carefully made and I much welcome that. This is one of the greatest Disney films. Great actors make the difference too. Bob Hoskins is English but speaks with an excellent American accent, not to mention that he does the amazing thing of acting against the air. Joanna Cassidy, Charles Fleischer, Alan Tilvern, Stubby Kaye, Cristopher Lloyd and Kathleen Turner are awesome too. Kathleen Turner is the voice of Jessica Rabbit, with that sexy and sensual voice. guess what! Even the singer Frank Sinatra has a minor role in this film as the hilarious but useless Singing Sword. Even without looking at the credits, who wouldn't recognize that great voice? Frank Sinatra's voice is just as recognizable as Nat King Cole's or Sterling Holloway's. As for the characters, the weasels are a perfect example of chronical stupidity. They're humorous because they're always laughing, even though they know what happens to someone who can't stop laughing. Marvin Acme is the king of the jokes, always humorous and cheerful and at his funniest with his mythical hand-buzzer. Angelo is an idiot, drunk and greedy guy, but funny at the same time. Dolores is a great character. Maroon is an interesting character with half a dark side and half a good side. Judge Doom is a great villain, humorous, mysterious and somewhat sinister. Roger Rabbit is hilarious and very jolly - that's his only purpose as a cartoon, like he says himself. Jessica Rabbit is a very sexy cartoon, one of the most beautiful and sexiest ever - she's not bad, she's just drawn that way. Benny the Cab is funny. Baby Herman is a bit annoying - he might look innocent at first, but he is extremely rude and he loves to woo women. Eddie Valiant is another great character - grumpy, serious and funny sometimes. And he looks very much like my godfather in appearance. The movie takes place in Hollywood, 1947. It does recreate the 40's very well. That influence is notorious in many ways, including the cars used. Before finishing, let me say that I like rabbits very much. They're adorable and very cute animals, although in the cartoons they aren't as cute - but they're usually funny in cartoons. This should definitely be on Top 250. Did you know - TriviaSince the movie was being made by Disney's Touchstone Pictures, Warner Bros. would only allow use of their biggest cartoon stars, Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, if they got as much screen time as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. For that reason, they were always in pairs, such as the piano battle between Daffy and Donald and the parachute scene with Bugs and Mickey. This was continued with Porky Pig and Tinker Bell at the movie's ending. - GoofsThe Hollywood sign is visible through Eddie Valiant's office window. In 1947, the sign would read HOLLYWOODLAND, the \"LAND\" part of the sign was taken off in 1949. - Quotes Jessica Rabbit: You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do. Eddie Valiant: You don't know how hard it is being a man looking at a woman looking the way you do. Jessica Rabbit: I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way. - Crazy creditsPorky Pig closes out the movie telling the characters \"That's All, Folks\" and then saying the same thing to the viewers. Tinkerbell then appears fading the entire screen to black. - Alternate versionsSome versions include an extra sequence (called the \"Pig Head Sequence\"): Eddie Valiant had gone into Toontown, ambushed by the weasels and had a pig's head \"tooned\" onto his. He went home and took a shower during which Jessica walks into his apartment. This scene was cut from the original release, but did appear in theatrical trailers and a television broadcast. A scene cut from the theatrical version where Jessica rolls up her dress to reveal her stockings as she sits cross-legged is included in this sequence. - ConnectionsEdited into Behind the Ears: The True Story of Roger Rabbit (2003) - How long is Who Framed Roger Rabbit?Powered by Alexa Details - Release date - Countries of origin - Language - Also known as - Quin enga a Roger Rabbit? - Filming locations - 3280 Hyperion Avenue, Los Angeles, California, USA(end of car chase scene where Roger, Eddie Valiant, and Benny the Cab escape police and weasels) - Production companies - See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office - Budget - $70,000,000 (estimated) - Gross US & Canada - $156,452,370 - Opening weekend US & Canada - $11,226,239 - Jun 26, 1988 - Gross worldwide - $329,803,958 Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content.",
