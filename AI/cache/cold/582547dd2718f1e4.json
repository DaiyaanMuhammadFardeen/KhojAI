A graduate of the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School of Finance, Trump followed in his fathers footsteps into real estate development, making his mark in New York City. He believes in the exceptionalism of the American spirit and wants to see the United States succeed. An accomplished author, Trump has written numerous bestsellers.
