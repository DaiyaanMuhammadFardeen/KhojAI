  "content": "Legal Headaches The inventor faced a nearly 20-year legal battle with other scientists, including Gray and Meucci, who claimed they created telephone prototypes prior to Bells patent. government moved to withdraw the patent issued to Bell, but after a series of rulings, the Bell company won in a Supreme Court decision. While the Bell Company faced over 550 court challenges, in the end, none were successful. Inventions and Accomplishments In addition to the telephone, Bell worked on hundreds of projects throughout his career and received patents in various fields. Some of his other notable inventions were: The metal detector: Bell initially came up with this device to locate a bullet inside of assassinated President James A. Photophone: The photophone allowed transmission of speech on a beam of light. Graphophone: This improved version of the phonograph could record and play back sound. Audiometer: This gadget was used to detect hearing problems. In 1880, Bell was awarded the French Volta Prize, and with the money, he founded a facility devoted to scientific discovery, the Volta Laboratory in Washington, D.C. Quotes by Bell While Bell is typically known for what he invented, hes also remembered for what he said and wrote. Some famous quotes attributed to Bell include: When one door closes another door opens; but we so often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door, that we do not see the ones which open for us. A man's own judgment should be the final appeal in all that relates to himself. Before anything else, preparation is the key to success. Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand. The suns rays do not burn until brought to focus. Great discoveries and improvements invariably involve the cooperation of many minds. The most successful men in the end are those whose success is the result of steady accretion. The only difference between success and failure is the ability to take action. You cannot force ideas. Successful ideas are the result of slow growth. The inventor looks upon the world and is not contented with things as they are. He wants to improve whatever he sees, he wants to benefit the world; he is haunted by an idea. The spirit of invention possesses him, seeking materialization.",
