By Nick Romano Nick Romano Nick Romano is a senior editor at Entertainment Weekly with 15 years of journalism experience covering entertainment. His work previously appeared in Vanity Fair, Vulture, IGN, and more. EW's editorial guidelines December 19, 2024 p.m. ET 4 Comments The two playable figures of Assassins Creed Shadows are emblematic of the nearly 20-year history of the popular video game series. Yasuke (voiced by Tongayi Chirisa), based on the historical figure of the same name, feels aligned with the franchises recent action-adventure entries; hes a Black samurai of African origins and much more of a brawler like the protagonists of Assassins Creed Odyssey (2018) and Assassins Creed Valhalla (2020). However, if youre a fan of the earliest games, Naoe (MASUMI) is the way to go; a shinobi Assassin, she brings back the classic stealth gameplay, capable of blending in with shadows and speeding across rooftops unnoticed to stalk her targets. Naoes the fastest Assassin we ever made, Jonathan Dumont, creative director of Assassins Creed Shadows, tells Entertainment Weekly. She runs super fast, she has a lot of gadgets to keep her stealth so that she doesn't have to fight often. We wanted to satisfy that for players that come in for that ninja-Assassin game. Anime fans will even be able to pull off their own \"Naruto run\": leaning forward, arms bent back, sprinting at full speed. \"We do have a run on top of buildings that has a little bit of a wink-wink to it,\" Dumont hints.

Ubisoft Jon Snow returns in Game of Thrones: Kingsroad video game watch the new trailer The creative gives EW exclusive insights into Naoes backstory in the game, which is set against the backdrop of feudal Japan, specifically the Sengoku period. Naoe hails from the Iga province, a rural, remote locale in the middle of the country that also plays into the origins of the shinobi or ninjas. While the narrative of Yasuke introduces players to the nobility of this era, Dumont says the creative team wanted to show the opposite with Naoe: the day-to-day, relatable, hardworking farmhands. Assassins Creed Shadows plays out through the dueling perspectives of both Yasuke and Naoe. Their stories start to collide in 1579, the year that the son of feudal lord Oda Nobunaga, the daimy Yasuke serves, tries and fails to invade Iga. [Naoe] was shielded by her father from whats happening in the world, and it comes crashing down, Dumont explains. She is pushed into war. She doesnt know much about her origins. Her fathers been training her, but she doesnt know much about her mother, whos been gone. But as a cool proverb from Japan says, a frog in a well knows nothing of the sea. She is tossed into the real world, and through that, she will learn that she is not just a shinobi, that there is a little bit of a lineage or at least some mystery about some sort of different type of shinobi. Theyre Assassins, so shes somewhat linked to that.

Dumont declines to go much further into detail to preserve some of the story points, but he teases how, as she learns more about what it means to be part of the world of Assassins, shell have to navigate a Japan in the midst of war. She will start a bit of a path of vengeance or fulfilling a promise that she made to her family, he says. As she discovers a world in need, she begins to really value the community values her father taught. Can she make a better world? [She realizes] they are people who cannot defend themselves, which is tied a little bit more to the models of the [Assassin] Brotherhood. Naoe and Junjiro in 'Assassin's Creed Shadows'. Ubisoft Secret, dark Pac-Man reimagining revealed as next game: 'It was so f---ed up!' As seen in EWs exclusive images from Shadows, a kid by the name of Junjiro becomes a focal point. He's \"the future Naoe hopes Japan will be,\" Dumont notes. Naoe's storyline is very much entangled in the character's skillsets, which involve a grappling hook that allows her to swiftly scale tall structures; kunai and smoke bombs that allow her to distract targets; and a Hidden Blade, the signature weapon of an Assassin, she can use to take out her targets. Each item is linked to an element from her backstory, specifically the survival skills imparted by her father. \"The Hidden Blade is given by her father, and we're going to learn a little bit more what that means,\" Dumont says. Altogether, \"She does feel like a panther looking at her prey.\" In the early development, it became clear to the team that Shadows would be a two-person story, and the characters began to play off each other as the creation process went on. While Yasuke is considered level-headed, Naoe is more hotheaded. Yasuke is more capable in combat as part of the samurai order, while Naoe runs into trouble when facing four or five adversaries at once. But while Naoe can gracefully sleek through in shadow, Yasuke has difficulty performing a signature Assassin's Creed move, the Leap of Faith, jumping from a great height to land safely in a bale of hay, a pile of flowers, or some other cushioning agent. How Secret Level brought the propulsive Sifu and a killer hallway fight back to life (exclusive) \"He doesn't do the Leap of Faith,\" Dumont reveals. \"He just crashes right into the haystack, and he hurts his butt, too. So, it's pretty funny.\" Jokes aside, he says the team wanted to satisfy the two main types of Assassin's Creed fans with Shadows with both characters. \"We have fans from more than 15 years of Assassin's,\" he continues. \"A lot of people like Assassin's at the start with the stealth approach: hiding in the shadows and the crowd. Then we have a little bit more of the action-oriented ones that [liked] Odyssey, Origins, and Valhalla. We try to satisfy both types of players, but also try to not dilute too much of what they like about it.\" Assassin's Creed Shadows will arrive this Feb. 14 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series XS, Ubisoft+, Amazon Luna, Macs with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store, Windows PC through the Ubisoft Store, and Steam and the Epic Games Store. : Gaming Gaming Genres Action Games View comments.",
