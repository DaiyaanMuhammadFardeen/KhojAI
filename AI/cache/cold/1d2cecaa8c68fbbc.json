Our program Computer Science Ph.D. program is designed as an innovative program that aligns with the applied research needs of the industry. This approach does not preclude graduates from entering tenure-track positions, but instead broadens and better prepares them for additional opportunities. The program is envisioned to take 4 years to complete for full-time students. It leverages our existing research clusters (and curriculum) in the areas of artificial intelligence, data engineering/science, computer and network security, information technology, software engineering, game design, cyber security, and quantum computing, which are in high demand in the region and beyond. Abhishek Parakh, Director, Ph.D. in Computer Science About the Doctoral Degree in Computer Science The Computer Science Ph.D. program is an innovative program that blends the highest level of theoretical foundations with the practice of Computer Science. By using state-of-the-art computing technologies to meet current and projected market demands for Computer Science experts in academia, industry, and government sectors, the program will produce cutting-edge researchers and well-prepared educators. The students will be involved in innovative research projects and gain expertise in advanced computer science areas such as artificial intelligence, data engineering/science, computer and network security, information technology, and software engineering, which are in high demand in the region and beyond. This program is unique in that the students can tailor their research focus to their professional goals by aligning towards academia or the applied research needs of industry. The program provides students with opportunities in computer science research, advanced project development, and industrial internships. Information Sessions for Fall 2026 Admission (Application Deadline Feb. 1, 2026) Benefits of Computer Science Ph.D. @ Kennesaw State University Customized Research Conduct innovative research projects tailored to students specific professional goals, whether in academia or the applied research needs of industry. Study Flexibility Gain valuable expertise in advanced areas of study, including artificial intelligence, immersive technologies, computer and network security, quantum computing, information technology, software engineering, data engineering/science and project development. Internships You will have many opportunities to gain hands-on, real-world experience by participating in internships during your time in the program, preparing you to advance in your career. Practical Skill Application Develop practical Computer Science and research skills that can be applied to high-paying industry fields immediately upon graduation. Graduate Research/Teaching Assistantships Admitted full-time students, in good standing, are funded (contingent on availability of funds) through the duration of the program, receiving a competitive Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) or Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) salary and tuition waivers. Faculty Research Areas Research is an important component of the faculty and student activities in the College of Computing and Software Engineering. Our distingushed faculty members work in a wide variety of research areas. In the list below you can see a listing of our faculty and the various research areas they are working in. Click on the major research grouping below, to see the subareas and the links to the faculty members research pages. Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Subareas: Machine Learning, Adversarial ML, Agentic AI, Applied AI, Trustworthy ML, AI for SE, Cognitive & Computational Psychology, Computational Creativity, and LLMs. The Computer Science Ph.D. Program is designed in a manner that works for the full-time students but also the flexibility of the part-time student. Students are required to complete 72 hours of core requirements, electives and dissertation research before the defense of their dissertation. Kennesaw State's Computer Science Ph.D. Handbook sets forth the policies, requirements, and expectations for the Computer Science Ph.D. Funding The Computer Science Ph.D. program at KSU is highly competitive, both for admission as well as for funding. Admitted students who request funding may be eligible for a Graduate Research Assistantship (GRA) or a Graduate Teaching Assistantship (GTA). Funded students receive support in the form of a Graduate Assistant appointment and a tuition waiver. Funding is available from multiple sources. students are encouraged to directly reach out to the Program Faculty of the Computer Science Ph.D. program to inquire about available research funding from external sources; and to reach out to the Program Director regarding institutional funding. In addition, scholarships may be available through federal agencies as well as industry that a prospective student may seek. Admission to Computer Science Ph.D. Program The program committee considers several factors when making admissions decisions, including academic performance at prior institutions, statement of purpose, and letters of recommendation. GRE scores are optional. Following represents the minimum requirements for admissions into the CS Ph.D. program: An undergraduate or graduate degree in Computer Science or a related field from an accredited university. Other degrees are considered on a case-by-case basis for those who show extraordinary background. A cumulative GPA of at least 3.25 from an undergraduate degree or 3.5 from a graduate degree (on a 4.0 grade scale). Lower GPA is considered on a case-by-case basis for those who show extraordinary background. GRE Score Report - (Optional). If you do wish to submit a GRE report, request that your scores be sent electronically to KSU (school code 5359). No department code is necessary. Resume or CV Statement of how this degree facilitates your career goals, recent accomplishments and activities, and research interest. Three Letters of Recommendation from academic or professional contacts. Successful completion of Math courses through Calculus II and Discrete Math, and undergraduate Data Structure Course. General Admission requirements include: Meet all KSU Graduate College Admission Requirements We currently have two admission cycles. Applications for the Fall semester are due: February 1st and for the Spring semester: August 1st. How long will the program take? The Computer Science Ph.D. program is a 4 year program for most full-time students. Are the courses offered online? NO. Program is an in-person program. Can I pursue the program part-time, while working a full-time job? YES, KSU's computer Science Ph.D. is also designed for those who are eager to pursue a degree yet need to be part-time because of work commitments. Does the CS PhD Program accept transfer credits Graduate work taken at other regionally accredited institutions must be evaluated and approved by the program director and/or graduate committee in order to satisfy degree requirements. Such transfer credit cannot exceed 25% of the total semester hours required for the degree and cannot reduce residency requirements. How much does the program cost? This is a traditional, Ph.D. Therefore, most qualified students full-time students will receive a tuition waiver and a research stipend. Part-time students are self funded. What qualifies you as a full or part-time student? Full-time students take 9 credit hours per semester (fall/spring). 4 years in program Part-time students can take 3-6 credit hours per semester. All students must complete the program within 10 years of starting the program. Can I live on campus? Yes. The university provides on-campus housing at both our Kennesaw and Marietta campuses. There is also off campus housing options within a mile of the campus - most of which is on the bus line for the university. KSU does not pay for housing. All housing must be secured by and paid for by student. What degree is needed for admission to the PhD Program Students can enter the Computer Science Ph.D. program after successfully completing the bachelor's degree. Many of our students enter after completing their master's degree. Is the GRE needed for admissions? No. Kennesaw no longer requires the GRE for Graduate Admission. But if you do wish to submit your scores, you must request for them to be sent directly to KSU (school code 5359). How do you choose a Ph.D. advisor?
