Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. It includes learning, reasoning, and self-correction. Examples of AI applications include expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, machine vision, and generative tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity. As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have scrambled to promote how their products and services incorporate it. Often, what they refer to as \"AI\" is a well-established technology such as machine learning. AI requires specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No single programming language is used exclusively in AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia are all popular languages among AI developers. How does AI work? In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing that data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. This article is part of What is enterprise AI? A complete guide for businesses For example, an AI chatbot that is fed examples of text can learn to generate lifelike exchanges with people, and an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples. Generative AI techniques, which have advanced rapidly over the past few years, can create realistic text, images, music and other media. Programming AI systems focuses on cognitive skills such as the following: - Learning. This aspect of AI programming involves acquiring data and creating rules, known as algorithms, to transform it into actionable information. These algorithms provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for completing specific tasks. This aspect involves choosing the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome. This aspect involves algorithms continuously learning and tuning themselves to provide the most accurate results possible. This aspect uses neural networks, rule-based systems, statistical methods and other AI techniques to generate new images, text, music, ideas and so on. Differences among AI, machine learning and deep learning The terms AI, machine learning and deep learning are often used interchangeably, especially in companies' marketing materials, but they have distinct meanings. In short, AI describes the broad concept of machines simulating human intelligence, while machine learning and deep learning are specific techniques within this field. The term AI, coined in the 1950s, encompasses an evolving and wide range of technologies that aim to simulate human intelligence, including machine learning and deep learning. Machine learning enables software to autonomously learn patterns and predict outcomes by using historical data as input. This approach became more effective with the availability of large training data sets. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, aims to mimic the brain's structure using layered neural networks. It underpins many major breakthroughs and recent advances in AI, including autonomous vehicles and ChatGPT. Why is AI important? AI is important for its potential to change how we live, work and play. It has been effectively used in business to automate tasks traditionally done by humans, including customer service, lead generation, fraud detection and quality control. In a number of areas, AI can perform tasks more efficiently and accurately than humans. It is especially useful for repetitive, detail-oriented tasks such as analyzing large numbers of legal documents to ensure relevant fields are properly filled in. AI's ability to process massive data sets gives enterprises insights into their operations they might not otherwise have noticed. The rapidly expanding array of generative AI tools is also becoming important in fields ranging from education to marketing to product design. Advances in AI techniques have not only helped fuel an explosion in efficiency, but also opened the door to entirely new business opportunities for some larger enterprises. Prior to the current wave of AI, for example, it would have been hard to imagine using computer software to connect riders to taxis on demand, yet Uber has become a Fortune 500 company by doing just that. AI has become central to many of today's largest and most successful companies, including Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Meta, which use AI to improve their operations and outpace competitors. At Alphabet subsidiary Google, for example, AI is central to its eponymous search engine, and self-driving car company Waymo began as an Alphabet division. The Google Brain research lab also invented the transformer architecture that underpins recent NLP breakthroughs such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. What are the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence? AI technologies, particularly deep learning models such as artificial neural networks, can process large amounts of data much faster and make predictions more accurately than humans can. While the huge volume of data created on a daily basis would bury a human researcher, AI applications using machine learning can take that data and quickly turn it into actionable information. A primary disadvantage of AI is that it is expensive to process the large amounts of data AI requires. As AI techniques are incorporated into more products and services, organizations must also be attuned to AI's potential to create biased and discriminatory systems, intentionally or inadvertently. Advantages of AI The following are some advantages of AI: - Excellence in detail-oriented jobs. AI is a good fit for tasks that involve identifying subtle patterns and relationships in data that might be overlooked by humans. For example, in oncology, AI systems have demonstrated high accuracy in detecting early-stage cancers, such as breast cancer and melanoma, by highlighting areas of concern for further evaluation by healthcare professionals. - Efficiency in data-heavy tasks. AI systems and automation tools dramatically reduce the time required for data processing. This is particularly useful in sectors like finance, insurance and healthcare that involve a great deal of routine data entry and analysis, as well as data-driven decision-making. For example, in banking and finance, predictive AI models can process vast volumes of data to forecast market trends and analyze investment risk. - Time savings and productivity gains. AI and robotics can not only automate operations but also improve safety and efficiency. In manufacturing, for example, AI-powered robots are increasingly used to perform hazardous or repetitive tasks as part of warehouse automation, thus reducing the risk to human workers and increasing overall productivity. - Consistency in results. Today's analytics tools use AI and machine learning to process extensive amounts of data in a uniform way, while retaining the ability to adapt to new information through continuous learning. For example, AI applications have delivered consistent and reliable outcomes in legal document review and language translation. - Customization and personalization. AI systems can enhance user experience by personalizing interactions and content delivery on digital platforms. On e-commerce platforms, for example, AI models analyze user behavior to recommend products suited to an individual's preferences, increasing customer satisfaction and engagement. - Round-the-clock availability. AI programs do not need to sleep or take breaks. For example, AI-powered virtual assistants can provide uninterrupted, 24/7 customer service even under high interaction volumes, improving response times and reducing costs. AI systems can scale to handle growing amounts of work and data. This makes AI well suited for scenarios where data volumes and workloads can grow exponentially, such as internet search and business analytics. - Accelerated research and development. AI can speed up the pace of R&D in fields such as pharmaceuticals and materials science. By rapidly simulating and analyzing many possible scenarios, AI models can help researchers discover new drugs, materials or compounds more quickly than traditional methods. - Sustainability and conservation. AI and machine learning are increasingly used to monitor environmental changes, predict future weather events and manage conservation efforts. Machine learning models can process satellite imagery and sensor data to track wildfire risk, pollution levels and endangered species populations, for example. - Process optimization. AI is used to streamline and automate complex processes across various industries. For example, AI models can identify inefficiencies and predict bottlenecks in manufacturing workflows, while in the energy sector, they can forecast electricity demand and allocate supply in real time. Disadvantages of AI The following are some disadvantages of AI: - High costs. Developing AI can be very expensive. Building an AI model requires a substantial upfront investment in infrastructure, computational resources and software to train the model and store its training data. After initial training, there are further ongoing costs associated with model inference and retraining. As a result, costs can rack up quickly, particularly for advanced, complex systems like generative AI applications; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated that training the company's GPT-4 model cost over $100 million. - Technical complexity. Developing, operating and troubleshooting AI systems -- especially in real-world production environments -- requires a great deal of technical know-how. In many cases, this knowledge differs from that needed to build non-AI software.",
