  "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is poised to become increasingly integral to our daily lives, facilitating interactions with smart devices through chat, speech, gestures, and various cues. These advancements will significantly enhance the efficiency of our routines both at home and in the workplace, highlighting the necessity of operating these technologies in a secure and safe manner. Under the vision of \"AI for All,\" Samsung plans to integrate AI services across all product lines, enabling users to enjoy a more convenient and enriched daily life. At Samsung Research, our mission is to develop innovative AI solutions that enrich the customer experience for the billions of users and devices under the Samsung brand. We are committed to shaping a new era of connected living with AI, creating entirely new experiences and values tailored for users. Our principles emphasize being user-centric, always safe, always helpful, and always learning, with a focus on fairness, accountability, and transparency. We focus on developing device AI methodologies while incorporating a range of applied AI techniques. We strive to enable seamless interaction between users and Samsung devices, ensuring a smooth experience amid the complexities of modern technology. Our work also extends to developing multimodal agentic systems through the integration of speech recognition, language comprehension, and visual understanding technologies. Our goal is to enhance the intelligence of generative AI models through extensive research in large language models (LLMs) and code models. Our commitment includes building reliable models and services using technologies such as reinforcement learning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), prompt engineering, and efficient model serving. We tackle fundamental challenges such as integrating learning and perception with high-level knowledge. This approach aims to enhance reasoning capabilities by incorporating the users context and domain knowledge. This research not only improves our product competitiveness but also boosts internal productivity. We develop technologies that provide real-time multilingual translation in various apps such as translation tools, browsers, and Notes within smartphones. Additionally, typical use cases include converting the style of sentences when users write, recommending spelling/grammar, and suggesting appropriate response content. Our development of voice and sound AI technology aims to achieve a human-like understanding of speech and sounds, facilitating natural conversations and expressions. We are also enhancing listening experiences through advanced analysis and understanding. Our core technologies is the E2E Speech LLM solution, which includes voice-related solutions such as voice recognition, synthesis, and processing, as well as sound recognition, source separation, quality improvement, audio search, and voice biomarker-based Brain health. These technologies enable Samsung devices such as smartphones, home appliances and wearables to offer tailored intelligent services in various settings. In the case of videos in the smartphone gallery, there are cases where background noise is included, so we develop technologies that can reduce or amplify it. This can be used to search for target audio sources and separate them, like an audio eraser.\" As more Samsung devices come equipped with cameras, there is a significant opportunity to transform these from smart to AI-driven devices with the support of vision AI. We aim to provide a comprehensive and on-device vision solutions for Samsung devices, ranging from low-level camera sensor processing to high-level visual intelligence for smartphone and TV. Photos usually contain various text information, and the technology to recognize this text information has many applications. For example, in the case of a prescription photo, it contains information such as drug names, drugs, and dosages, so it can be registered in an app that automatically manages them. Another example is when signs/menus/newspapers/books contain text, it can perform useful functions such as copying & pasting these texts or searching and translating them. In addition, we develop generative AI technologies such as removing unnecessary objects from photos in the smartphone gallery, and generating wallpaper images that dynamically changes according to the weather and time. We are developing a generative AI model named Samsung Gauss. This model is inspired by Carl Friedrich Gauss, a renowned mathematician known for formulating the theory of normal distribution, which is crucial in fields like machine learning and AI. Samsung Gauss embodies our aim to harnessing the power of AI to significantly improve consumer lives worldwide. Samsung Gauss2 offers enhanced performance and efficiency by handling various data types simultaneously as a multimodal model that integrates language, code, and images. It is available in three distinct models designed for different purposes: Compact, Balanced, and Supreme. Compact Model: This small-sized model is specifically designed for efficient operation in limited computing environments, maximizing each device's unique capabilities for optimized on-device performance. Balanced Model: This model achieves a balance between stability and efficiency, providing consistent performance across a variety of tasks. Supreme Model: Aiming for top-tier performance, this model utilizes a new model architecture built upon the Balanced model, enabling significant reductions in computational requirements during training and inference while maintaining high levels of both performance and efficiency. Samsung Gauss2 supports up to 14 languages as well as various programming languages, depending on the model. To ensure maximum efficiency for these supported languages, Samsung has developed and incorporated its own stabilization techniques for training large language models (LLMs) and designed a custom Tokenizer. Looking ahead, Samsung aims to continually enhance the performance of its code.i service through Samsung Gauss2, improve the natural language question-and-answer functionality of the Samsung Gauss Portal, and support multimodal features such as understanding tables, charts, and creating images. Each of these enhancements is intended to boost productivity within the company. In Partnership with Bloomberg Media Studios As AI technology unfolds its boundless potential, ushering in a new era of experiences, it simultaneously poses potential social and ethical challenges. To ensure the sustainable and ethical deployment of AI and its applications, we have established the principles of Fairness, Transparency, and Accountability. These guidelines are not just about legal compliance but are a testament to our commitment to social and ethical responsibilities. To integrate these ethical principles into our corporate culture, they will be embedded into our internal guidelines and training programs. This initiative aims to educate and direct our employees toward the ethical development and use of AI. Fairness Our commitment extends to embedding the values of equality and diversity diversity across the AI systems entire lifecycle, ensuring that our AI does not perpetuate or amplify negative or unfair biases. We will make AI accessible to all users, promoting inclusivity. Transparency Users will be clearly informed when they are interacting with AI., fostering an environment of trust. AI will be designed to be explainable, allowing users to comprehend the basis of its decisions or recommendations within the bounds of technological possibility. The processes involving the collection or use of personal data by AI will be conducted with utmost transparency. Accountability We pledge to imbue our AI systems with social and ethical responsibility, reflecting our corporate values. AI systems will be fortified with robust security measures to safeguard against data breaches and cyberattacks, ensuring user data protection. Through our AI systems, we aim to contribute to society and enhance our stature as responsible corporate citizens.",
