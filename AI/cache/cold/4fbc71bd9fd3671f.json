  "content": "Khaleda Zia News Khaleda Zia (born August 15, 1945, Dinjpur, East Bengal, India [now in Bangladesh]) is a Bangladeshi politician who served as prime minister of Bangladesh in 199196 and 200106. She was the first woman to serve as prime minister of the country, and she governed during a period of natural disasters, economic distress, and civil unrest. Khaleda was the third of five children born to Taiyaba and Iskandar Majumdar, a businessman. In 1960 she passed the government matriculation exam and later attended Surendranath College in Dinjpur. In 1959 she married Zia ur-Rahman, a leader in the fight for the independence of Bangladesh, then part of Pakistan. During the struggle in 1971 she was kept under house arrest, though she remained largely uninterested in politics, even after her husband became president of Bangladesh in 1977. After her husband was assassinated in 1981 by military officers, she became politically active, and in 1984 she assumed the leadership of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Khaleda was arrested repeatedly during the dictatorship of Hussein Mohammad Ershad in the 1980s, but in 1991 she led the opposition to victory and became prime minister. During Khaledas first term she attempted to tackle the countrys dire economic problems by privatizing industry and encouraging private investment; her government also focused on improving the countrys educational system and expanding the economic opportunities available to women. Her efforts were hampered, however, by a cyclone in 1991 that killed more than 130,000 people and caused more than $2 billion in damage. In February 1996 she overwhelmingly won a second term in office, but her victory was tainted by an opposition-led boycott of the election; heeding the call of opposition groups, which claimed that the government would rig the outcome in its favour, roughly nine-tenths of eligible voters abstained. After a wave of strikes and protests, she resigned the following month. In 2001 Khaleda regained power, promising to eliminate both corruption and terrorism. Both, however, remained problematic throughout her second term. She stepped down at the end of 2006, passing authority to a caretaker administration until elections could be held. - In full: - Khaleda Zia ur-Rahman - Ne: - Khaleda Majumdar - Born: - August 15, 1945, Dinjpur, East Bengal, India [now in Bangladesh] (age 80) - Title / Office: - prime minister (2001-2006), Bangladesh - prime minister (1991-1996), Bangladesh - Political Affiliation: - Bangladesh Nationalist Party In January 2007 a state of emergency was declared in Bangladesh, and an army-backed government took power. It subsequently launched an antigraft campaign, and in September Khaleda was arrested on corruption charges. In 2014 she and others went on trial for embezzling funds intended for a charity. She was convicted in February 2018 and began serving a five-year sentence, which rendered her unable to contest elections later in the year. Khaleda denied any wrongdoing, claiming the verdict was politically motivated. In October she was convicted on additional charges of graft, while her February conviction was upheld and the sentence was extended to 10 years. That same month her son was sentenced in absentia to life in prison. Khaledas health began to decline in April 2019, and in March 2020 she was released from prison on a temporary basis while undergoing medical treatment.",
