Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Its used everywhere from web apps and automation tools to data science and artificial intelligence. Whether youre streaming a show, booking a flight, or chatting with an AI, Python is likely working behind the scenes. Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released on February 20, 1991. While the word \"python\" might bring to mind a large snake, the languages name actually comes from the classic BBC comedy series Monty Pythons Flying Circus. What makes Python unique is that it began as the vision and work of a single person. Unlike most languages born in big tech companies, Python was created by Guido driven by a simple goal: to make programming more intuitive and enjoyable. From that idea, a global community has grown. Thousands of developers, educators, scientists, and enthusiasts continue to shape Python, expanding its reach into AI, data science, education, and beyond. Today, Python is maintained and advanced by the Python Software Foundation (PSF), a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the language, its ecosystem, and the global community that keeps it thriving. Python is everywhere from websites and mobile apps to AI assistants, satellites, and even medical devices. Its one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, with billions of lines of code written, shared, and reused every day. Behind this success is a vibrant global community that makes learning and collaboration easy for everyone, from absolute beginners to AI researchers. Python is also one of the best languages to start learning programming. Heres why: Learning Python opens doors to countless career paths from data analysis and web development to machine learning and cybersecurity. Its not just a language; its a key skill for thriving in a world shaped by technology. Even if you never become a professional programmer, understanding Python helps you automate tasks, analyze information, and think more logically valuable abilities in any field. Python is one of the most versatile tools you can learn it opens doors across nearly every industry. With solid Python skills, you can work in fields like software development, data analytics, machine learning, automation, web development, cybersecurity, or quality testing. But its reach goes far beyond IT. Python is increasingly used in finance, healthcare, education, science, and even the arts. Educators use it to teach logic and problem-solving, economists use it to analyze markets, psychologists to study behavior, and designers to automate creative workflows. Its also the language behind countless research projects, simulations, and AI-driven innovations shaping the modern world. As technology becomes part of nearly every profession, Python stands out as a universal language simple enough for beginners, yet powerful enough for experts. Whether youre managing data, automating reports, or exploring new ideas, Python helps you do it faster, smarter, and more creatively. Learn, certify, and succeed! Imagine writing your own apps, automating tasks, or even creating an AI-powered project all with Python. Its a versatile, multi-paradigm language trusted by innovators and global companies like Google, Meta, Cisco, and Netflix. With its clear, human-friendly syntax, Python is the perfect first language to learn and a powerful skill to master. Start your journey with the Python Essentials 1 course and prepare for the PCEP certification exam. Once youve learned the fundamentals, continue with Python Essentials 2 and prepare for the PCAP certification exam to deepen your programming skills. If youre ready to take your expertise even further, explore the professional-level courses and specialization paths that prepare you for PCPP, PCAD, PCAT, PCAA, and PCAS certifications your next step toward becoming an advanced, industry-ready Python professional. Back in 1999, Guido van Rossum the creator of Python outlined a simple yet visionary set of goals for his language. He wanted Python to be: More than two decades later, those goals have not only been achieved but surpassed. Python has become the common language of innovation powering everything from artificial intelligence and data science to web development, robotics, cybersecurity, and automation. Its used at NASA to analyze mission data, at Netflix to recommend what youll watch next, and at OpenAI to train intelligent models. Depending on which source you check, Python now ranks at or near the top of every major programming language index consistently holding first place in both the TIOBE Programming Community Index and the PYPL Popularity of Programming Languages Index. Python is no longer just a programming language its a global standard for teaching, learning, and creating technology. Mature, reliable, and constantly evolving, Python continues to prove that simplicity and power can go hand in hand. Investing your time in learning Python isnt just smart its future-proof. Sep 2025 1 2 3 4 5 Sep 2021 3 4 1 2 6 Where can we see Python in action? The short answer is: almost everywhere. From the apps on your phone to the systems that power global businesses, Python quietly runs behind the scenes, shaping how we search, shop, learn, and communicate online. Its the language behind complex Internet services such as search engines, cloud computing platforms, and social media networks. Every time you stream music, get directions, or ask a chatbot a question theres a good chance Python is part of what makes it all work. Python has become the go-to language for modern innovation. It powers artificial intelligence (AI) models, automates repetitive tasks, analyzes mountains of data, and supports the development of machine learning systems used in everything from voice assistants and image recognition to self-driving cars and recommendation engines. Whenever you interact with technologies like ChatGPT, Google Photos, or Netflixs content suggestions, Python is working in the background. Many of todays developer tools and cloud platforms are built using Python. Scientists and researchers rely on it for data analysis, visualization, and simulation, while software testers use it to automate and repeat test procedures efficiently. Educators love it for its simplicity, and engineers appreciate it for its power and flexibility. The list keeps growing every year. Python is a great choice for: And thats just the beginning Pythons versatility and community support ensure that new and exciting uses appear every day.

{"doc_id":"71bbcd80621798b2","title":"The History of Python: Python's Design Philosophy","content":"First of all, Python was originally conceived as a one-person skunkworks project there was no official budget, and I wanted results quickly, in part so that I could convince management to support the project (in which I was fairly successful). This led to a number of timesaving rules: - Borrow ideas from elsewhere whenever it makes sense. - Things should be as simple as possible, but no simpler. (Einstein) - Do one thing well (The \"UNIX philosophy\"). - Dont fret too much about performance--plan to optimize later when needed. - Dont fight the environment and go with the flow. - Dont try for perfection because good enough is often just that. - (Hence) its okay to cut corners sometimes, especially if you can do it right later. - The Python implementation should not be tied to a particular platform. Its okay if some functionality is not always available, but the core should work everywhere. - Dont bother users with details that the machine can handle (I didnt always follow this rule and some of the of the disastrous consequences are described in later sections). - Support and encourage platform-independent user code, but dont cut off access to platform capabilities or properties (This is in sharp contrast to Java.) - A large complex system should have multiple levels of extensibility. This maximizes the opportunities for users, sophisticated or not, to help themselves. - Errors should not be fatal. That is, user code should be able to recover from error conditions as long as the virtual machine is still functional. - At the same time, errors should not pass silently (These last two items naturally led to the decision to use exceptions throughout the implementation.) - A bug in the users Python code should not be allowed to lead to undefined behavior of the Python interpreter; a core dump is never the users fault. Although I will discuss more of ABC's influence on Python a little later, Id like to mention one readability rule specifically: punctuation characters should be used conservatively, in line with their common use in written English or high-school algebra. Exceptions are made when a particular notation is a long-standing tradition in programming languages, such as x*y for multiplication, a[i] for array subscription, or x.foo for attribute selection, but Python does not use $ to indicate variables, nor ! to indicate operations with side effects. Tim Peters, a long time Python user who eventually became its most prolific and tenacious core developer, attempted to capture my unstated design principles in what he calls the Zen of Python. I quote it here in its entirety: - Beautiful is better than ugly. - Explicit is better than implicit. - Simple is better than complex. - Complex is better than complicated. - Flat is better than nested. - Sparse is better than dense. - Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. - Although practicality beats purity. - Errors should never pass silently. - Unless explicitly silenced. - In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. - There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. - Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. - Now is better than never. - Although never is often better than right now. - If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. - If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. - Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! - The ABC group strived for perfection. For example, they used tree-based data structure algorithms that were proven to be optimal for asymptotically large collections (but were not so great for small collections). - The ABC group wanted to isolate the user, as completely as possible, from the big, bad world of computers out there. Not only should there be no limit on the range of numbers, the length of strings, or the size of collections (other than the total memory available), but users should also not be required to deal with files, disks, saving, or other programs. ABC should be the only tool they ever needed. This desire also caused the ABC group to create a complete integrated editing environment, unique to ABC (There was an escape possible from ABCs environment, for sure, but it was mostly an afterthought, and not accessible directly from the language.) - The ABC group assumed that the users had no prior computer experience (or were willing to forget it). Thus, alternative terminology was introduced that was considered more newbie-friendly than standard programming terms. For example, procedures were called how-tos and variables locations. - The ABC group designed ABC without an evolutionary path in mind, and without expecting user participation in the design of the language. ABC was created as a closed system, as flawless as its designers could make it. Users were not encouraged to look under the hood. Although there was talk of opening up parts of the implementation to advanced users in later stages of the project, this was never realized.","url":"http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/01/pythons-design-philosophy.html"}

Founded more than 2000 years ago, Paris is a modern and vibrant city with significant commercial, cultural, academic, scientific, administrative, business activity. From the Romans to the Vth Republic, Paris has a rich 2000 year history. See details of Paris history. The French Kings, who governed France, from 448 until 1848, commissioned many beautiful monuments, such as Versailles Palace and the Louvre Museum. The Catholic Church and Parisians built many great churches, including Notre Dame and Sainte Chapelle. Paris is a world capital city of shopping and fashion, with Channel, Dior, Vuitton, Yves Saint Laurent among many other top french fashion brands. The French tradition of good food still prevails in many restaurants, including gastronomic restaurants and excellent family style places. All of this turns Paris into a unique tourist city. Before Paris, the capital of France was Lyon (under the Romans). Paris first became the capital of France in 508 under King Clovis. After centuries with no unique capital of France, Paris retrieved its status of capital of France under King Philippe Auguste, who reigned between 1180 and 1223.

What is the landscape of Paris? Paris is the capital of what country? News Paris, city and capital of France, situated in the north-central part of the country. People were living on the site of the present-day city, located along the Seine River some 233 miles (375 km) upstream from the rivers mouth on the English Channel (La Manche), by about 7600 bce. The modern city has spread from the island (the le de la Cit) and far beyond both banks of the Seine. Paris occupies a central position in the rich agricultural region known as the Paris Basin, and it constitutes one of eight dpartements of the le-de-France administrative region. It is by far the countrys most important centre of commerce and culture. Area city, 41 square miles (105 square km); metropolitan area, 890 square miles (2,300 square km). (2020 est.) city, 2,145,906; (2020 est.) urban agglomeration, 10,858,874. Character of the city For centuries Paris has been one of the worlds most important and attractive cities. It is appreciated for the opportunities it offers for business and commerce, for study, for culture, and for entertainment; its gastronomy, haute couture, painting, literature, and intellectual community especially enjoy an enviable reputation. Its sobriquet the City of Light (la Ville Lumire), earned during the Enlightenment, remains appropriate, for Paris has retained its importance as a centre for education and intellectual pursuits. Pariss site at a crossroads of both water and land routes significant not only to France but also to Europe has had a continuing influence on its growth. Under Roman administration, in the 1st century bce, the original site on the le de la Cit was designated the capital of the Parisii tribe and territory. The Frankish king Clovis I had taken Paris from the Gauls by 494 ce and later made his capital there. Under Hugh Capet (ruled 987996) and the Capetian dynasty the preeminence of Paris was firmly established, and Paris became the political and cultural hub as modern France took shape. France has long been a highly centralized country, and Paris has come to be identified with a powerful central state, drawing to itself much of the talent and vitality of the provinces. The three main parts of historical Paris are defined by the Seine. At its centre is the le de la Cit, which is the seat of religious and temporal authority (the word cit connotes the nucleus of the ancient city). The Seines Left Bank (Rive Gauche) has traditionally been the seat of intellectual life, and its Right Bank (Rive Droite) contains the heart of the citys economic life, but the distinctions have become blurred in recent decades. The fusion of all these functions at the centre of France and, later, at the centre of an empire, resulted in a tremendously vital environment. In this environment, however, the emotional and intellectual climate that was created by contending powers often set the stage for great violence in both the social and political arenasthe years 1358, 1382, 1588, 1648, 1789, 1830, 1848, and 1871 being notable for such events. In its centuries of growth Paris has for the most part retained the circular shape of the early city. Its boundaries have spread outward to engulf the surrounding towns (bourgs), usually built around monasteries or churches and often the site of a market. From the mid-14th to the mid-16th century, the citys growth was mainly eastward; since then it has been westward. It comprises 20 arrondissements (municipal districts), each of which has its own mayor, town hall, and particular features. The numbering begins in the heart of Paris and continues in the spiraling shape of a snail shell, ending to the far east. Parisians refer to the arrondissements by number as the first (premier), second (deuxime), third (troisime), and so on. Adaptation to the problems of urbanizationsuch as immigration, housing, social infrastructure, public utilities, suburban development, and zoninghas produced the vast urban agglomeration. The Editors of Encyclopaedia BritannicaLandscape City site Paris is positioned at the centre of the le-de-France region, which is crossed by the Seine, Oise, and Marne rivers. The city is ringed with great forests of beech and oak; they are called the lungs of Paris, for they help to purify the air in the heavily industrialized region. The city proper is small; no corner is farther than about 6 miles (10 km) from the square in front of Notre-Dame Cathedral. It occupies a depression hollowed out by the Seine, and the surrounding heights have been respected as the limits of the city. Elevation varies from 430 feet (130 metres) at the butte of Montmartre, in the north, to 85 feet (26 metres) in the Grenelle area, in the southwest. The Seine flows for about 8 miles (13 km) through the centre of the city and 10 of the 20 arrondissements. It enters the city at the southeast corner, flows northwestward, and turns gradually southwestward, eventually leaving Paris at the southwest corner. As a result, what starts out as the streams east bank becomes its north bank and ends as the west bank, and the Parisians therefore adopted the simple, unchanging designation of Right Bank and Left Bank (when facing downstream). Specific places, however, are usually indicated by arrondissement or by quarter (quartier). At water level, some 30 feet (9 metres) below street level, the river is borderedat least on those portions not transformed into expresswaysby cobbled quays graced with trees and shrubs. From street level another line of trees leans toward the water. Between the two levels, the retaining walls, usually made of massive stone blocks, are decorated with the great iron rings once used to moor merchant vessels, and some are pierced by openings left by water gates for old palaces or inspection ports for subways, sewers, and underpasses. At intermittent points the walls are shawled in ivy. The garden effect of the Seines open waters and its tree-lined banks foster in part the appearance of Paris as a city well-endowed with green spaces. Tens of thousands of trees (mostly plane trees, with a scattering of chestnuts) line the streets as well, and numerous public parks, gardens, and squares dot the city. Most of the parks and gardens of the modern central city are on land that formerly was reserved for the kings on the old citys outskirts. Under Napoleon III, who had been impressed by Londons parks while living in Britain, two ancient royal military preserves at the approaches to Paris were made into English parksthe Bois de Boulogne to the west and the Bois de Vincennes to the east. Moreover, during his reign a large area of land was laid out in promenades and garden squares. Under Mayor Jacques Chirac in the late 20th century, the municipal government initiated efforts to create new parks, and such projects continued into the 21st century. The Promenade Plante is a partially elevated parkway built along an abandoned rail line and viaduct in the 12th arrondissement (municipal district) of Paris, on the right bank of the Seine River. It was the worlds first elevated park (first phase completed in 1994) and the first green space constructed on a viaduct; it has since inspired other cities to turn abandoned rail lines into public parkland. The entire feature runs some 4.5 km (about 3 miles) from the Opra Bastille to the Bois de Vincennes. Located underneath the elevated portion is the Viaduc des Arts, which stretches along the Avenue Daumesnil. Its former archways house specialized commercial establishments.","url":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Paris"}
{"doc_id":"4f000beecaeffebc","title":"Alexander Graham Bell: Telephone & Inventions | HISTORY","content":"Legal Headaches The inventor faced a nearly 20-year legal battle with other scientists, including Gray and Meucci, who claimed they created telephone prototypes prior to Bells patent. government moved to withdraw the patent issued to Bell, but after a series of rulings, the Bell company won in a Supreme Court decision. While the Bell Company faced over 550 court challenges, in the end, none were successful. Inventions and Accomplishments In addition to the telephone, Bell worked on hundreds of projects throughout his career and received patents in various fields. Some of his other notable inventions were: The metal detector: Bell initially came up with this device to locate a bullet inside of assassinated President James A. Photophone: The photophone allowed transmission of speech on a beam of light. Graphophone: This improved version of the phonograph could record and play back sound. Audiometer: This gadget was used to detect hearing problems. In 1880, Bell was awarded the French Volta Prize, and with the money, he founded a facility devoted to scientific discovery, the Volta Laboratory in Washington, D.C. Quotes by Bell While Bell is typically known for what he invented, hes also remembered for what he said and wrote. Some famous quotes attributed to Bell include: When one door closes another door opens; but we so often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door, that we do not see the ones which open for us. A man's own judgment should be the final appeal in all that relates to himself. Before anything else, preparation is the key to success. Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand. The suns rays do not burn until brought to focus. Great discoveries and improvements invariably involve the cooperation of many minds. The most successful men in the end are those whose success is the result of steady accretion. The only difference between success and failure is the ability to take action. You cannot force ideas. Successful ideas are the result of slow growth. The inventor looks upon the world and is not contented with things as they are. He wants to improve whatever he sees, he wants to benefit the world; he is haunted by an idea. The spirit of invention possesses him, seeking materialization.","url":"https://www.history.com/articles/alexander-graham-bell"}
{"doc_id":"1cfef7389940a389","title":"1870s – 1940s: Telephone | Imagining the Internet | Elon University","content":"This timeline is provided to help show how the dominant form of communication changes as rapidly as innovators develop new technologies. A brief historical overview: The printing press was the big innovation in communications until the telegraph was developed. Printing remained the key format for mass messages for years afterward, but the telegraph allowed instant communication over vast distances for the first time in human history. Telegraph usage faded as radio became easy to use and popularized; as radio was being developed, the telephone quickly became the fastest way to communicate person-to-person; after television was perfected and content for it was well developed, it became the dominant form of mass-communication technology; the internet came next, and newspapers, radio, telephones, and television are being rolled into this far-reaching information medium. Development of the Telephone World Changes Due to the Telephone Telephone Predictions The Development of the Telephone As with many innovations, the idea for the telephone came along far sooner than it was brought to reality. While Italian innovator Antonio Meucci (pictured at left) is credited with inventing the first basic phone in 1849, and Frenchman Charles Bourseul devised a phone in 1854, Alexander Graham Bell won the first U.S. patent for the device in 1876. Bell began his research in 1874 and had financial backers who gave him the best business plan for bringing it to market. In 1877-78, the first telephone line was constructed, the first switchboard was created and the first telephone exchange was in operation. Three years later, almost 49,000 telephones were in use. In 1880, Bell (in the photo below) merged this company with others to form the American Bell Telephone Company and in 1885 American Telegraph and Telephone Company (AT&T) was formed; it dominated telephone communications for the next century. At one point in time, Bell System employees purposely denigrated the U.S. telephone system to drive down stock prices of all phone companies and thus make it easier for Bell to acquire smaller competitors. By 1900 there were nearly 600,000 phones in Bells telephone system; that number shot up to 2.2 million phones by 1905, and 5.8 million by 1910. In 1915 the transcontinental telephone line began operating. By 1907, AT&T had a near monopoly on phone and telegraph service, thanks to its purchase of Western Union. Its president, Theodore Vail, urged at the time that a monopoly could most efficiently operate the nations far-flung communications network. At the urging of the public and AT&T competitors, the government began to investigate the company for anti-trust violations, thus forcing the 1913 Kingsbury Commitment, an agreement between AT&T vice president Nathan Kingsbury and the office of the U.S. Under this commitment, AT&T agreed to divest itself of Western Union and provide long-distance services to independent phone exchanges. During World War I, the government nationalized telephone and telegraph lines in the United States from June 1918 to July 1919, when, after a joint resolution of Congress, President Wilson issued an order putting them under the direction of the U.S. A year later, the systems were returned to private ownership, AT&T resumed its monopolistic hold, and by 1934 the government again acted, this time agreeing to allow it to operate as a regulated monopoly under the jurisdiction of the FCC. Public utility commissions in state and local jurisdictions were appointed regulators of AT&T and the nations independent phone companies, while the FCC regulated long-distance services conducted across state lines. They set the rates the phone companies could charge and determined what services and equipment each could offer. This stayed in effect until AT&Ts forced divestiture in 1984, the conclusion of a U.S. Department of Justice anti-trust suit that had been filed in 1974. The all-powerful company had become popularly known and disparaged as Ma Bell. AT&Ts local operations were divided into seven independent Regional Bell Operating Companies, known as the Baby Bells. AT&T became a long-distance-services company. By 1948, the 30 millionth phone was connected in the United States; by the 1960s, there were more than 80 million phone hookups in the U.S. and 160 million in the world; by 1980, there were more than 175 million telephone subscriber lines in the U.S. In 1993, the first digital cellular network went online in Orlando, Florida; by 1995 there were 25 million cellular phone subscribers, and that number exploded at the turn of the century, with digital cellular phone service expected to replace land-line phones for most U.S. customers by as early as 2010. World Changes Due to the Telephone Within 50 years of its invention, the telephone had become an indispensable tool in the United States. In the late 19th century, people raved about the telephones positive aspects and ranted about what they anticipated would be negatives. Their key points, recorded by Ithiel de Sola Pool in his 1983 book Forecasting the Telephone, mirror nearly precisely what was later predicted about the impact of the internet. For example, people said the telephone would: help further democracy; be a tool for grassroots organizers; lead to additional advances in networked communications; allow social decentralization, resulting in a movement out of cities and more flexible work arrangements; change marketing and politics; alter the ways in which wars are fought; cause the postal service to lose business; open up new job opportunities; allow more public feedback; make the world smaller, increasing contact between peoples of all nations and thus fostering world peace; increase crime and aid criminals; be an aid for physicians, police, fire, and emergency workers; be a valuable tool for journalists; bring people closer together, decreasing loneliness and building new communities; inspire a decline in the art of writing; have an impact on language patterns and introduce new words; and someday lead to an advanced form of the transmission of intelligence. Privacy was also a major concern. As is the case with the Internet, the telephone worked to improve privacy while simultaneously leaving people open to invasions of their privacy. In the beginning days of the telephone, people would often have to journey to the local general store or some other central point to be able to make and receive calls. Most homes werent wired together, and eavesdroppers could hear you conduct your personal business as you used a public phone. Switchboard operators who connected the calls would also regularly invade peoples privacy. The early house-to-house phone systems were often party lines on which a number of families would receive calls, and others were free to listen in and often chose to do so. Today, while most homes are wired and people can travel freely, conducting their phone conversations wirelessly, wiretapping and other surveillance methods can be utilized to listen in on their private business. Peoples privacy can also be interrupted by unwanted phone calls from telemarketers and others who wish to profit in some way just as Internet e-mail accounts receive unwanted sales pitches, known as spam. Yet, the invention of the telephone also worked to increase privacy in many ways. It permitted people to exchange information without having to put it in writing, and a call on the phone came to replace such intrusions on domestic seclusion as unexpected visits from relatives or neighbors and the pushy patter of door-to-door salesmen. The same could be said for the Internet privacy has been enhanced in some ways because e-mail and instant messaging have reduced the frequency of the jangling interruptions previously dished out by our telephones. Past Predictions About the Future of the Telephone President Rutherford B. Hayes to Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 on viewing the telephone for the first time: Thats an amazing invention, but who would ever want to use one of them? Bell offered to sell his telephone patent to Western Union for $100,000 in 1876, when he was struggling with the business. An account that is believed by some to be apocryphal, but still recounted in many telephone histories states that the committee appointed to investigate the offer filed the following report: We do not see that this device will be ever capable of sending recognizable speech over a distance of several miles. Messer Hubbard and Bell want to install one of their telephone devices in every city. The idea is idiotic on the face of it. Furthermore, why would any person want to use this ungainly and impractical device when he can send a messenger to the telegraph office and have a clear written message sent to any large city in the United States? Mr. Hubbards fanciful predictions, while they sound rosy, are based on wild-eyed imagination and lack of understanding of the technical and economic facts of the situation, and a posture of ignoring the obvious limitations of his device, which is hardly more than a toy This device is inherently of no use to us. We do not recommend its purchase. As reported in the book Bell by Robert V. Bruce, Kate Field, a British reporter who knew Bell, predicted in 1878 that eventually: While two persons, hundreds of miles apart, are talking together, they will actually see each other. Sir William Preece, chief engineer for the British Post Office, 1878, as reported in The Telephone in a Changing World by Marion May Dilts: There are conditions in America which necessitate the use of such instruments more than here. Here we have a superabundance of messengers, errand boys and things of that kind The absence of servants has compelled America to adopt communications systems for domestic purposes.

{"doc_id":"a2f9c41db2f29751","title":"The Story Behind the World’s First Telephone – The Historic England Blog","content":"Scottish-born Alexander Graham Bell (1847 to 1922), developed the worlds first working telephone, receiving a patent from the United States Patent Office 7 March 1876. Reputedly, the very first successful words using his new instrument, as Bell called it, were spoken by him to his associate Thomas Watson who was out of earshot in another room: Mr Watson, come here I want to see you. Bells family background a grandfather, father and uncle all elocutionists; a mother and wife who were deaf led him to obsessively research hearing and speech. Eventually, his work with deaf people and years of experimentation into acoustics and the human voice culminated in the momentous invention that changed the world. Here we look at the sometimes controversial life of this remarkable scientist and inventor. Please note: some of Bells views on Deaf people and Deafness are controversial and considered incorrect and offensive today. Some people might find these views distressing, so please read with discretion. The early life of Alexander Graham Bell Alexander Bell was unexceptional at his Scottish school, Weston House Academy in Elgin, but became a fine self-taught pianist and had a clever inquiring mind. At 12 years old he invented a simple device to dehusk wheat, using nail brushes, that a neighbour employed in his grain mill. In 1862, he left school at 15, moving to London, partly to escape from his over-bearing father, but also to care for his grandfather who encouraged his precocious intellect and sharpened his mind through serious discussion. Bell later returned to Weston House, becoming first a teacher of elocution and music and then as assistant master. In his spare time he experimented with electricity to transmit sound. He later briefly attended the University of Edinburgh, studying anatomy and physiology. Early experiments with sound Bells mothers hearing had started to fail when she was a child. The young Bell developed a method of talking in a deep resonant way close to her ear which helped her to hear, sparking his later research into acoustics. Bells father an eminent elocutionist and author on the subject encouraged his sons interest in speech and sound. Inspired by an automated talking head that they had been to see, the teenage Bell and his brother Melville (who later opened his own elocution school) made their own. It appeared to say mama when air was blown into it as Bell worked the lips. They also created a living talking dog by teaching the family terrier to growl on command, then manipulating the pets lips so the animal seemed to say how are you grandmama? Bell began helping his father at Visible Speech demonstrations. The elder Bell had developed a method of translating sounds made by the human voice into a series of written symbols in order to teach deaf people to speak (oralism). The symbols indicated how to use and shape the tongue and mouth. Moving to Canada Bells younger brother Edward had died of tuberculosis Spring 1867. Three years later, his older brother Melville died of the same disease. Now, with Bell himself ill with tuberculosis, his bereaved parents decided to relocate the surviving family to a healthier climate, buying a farm near Brantford, Ontario. The 23 year old Bell moved to Canada very reluctantly, having had some success in London working with pupils who were then described as Deaf-Mute an archaic term, now considered offensive, that meant a person who was unable to hear or speak. Bell continued using the Visible Speech method, set up a workshop and pursued his experiments into sound. Working with deafness In 1871, Bell took up a post at the Boston School, successfully teaching the Visible Speech system, then moved on to teach the same programme at the American Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb the first school for the deaf in America and the Clarke Institution for the Deaf-Mutes. A year later he set up in private practice in Boston the School of Vocal Physiology and Mechanics of Speech attracting a large number of pupils. Bell became a US citizen in 1882. At the time, the prevailing philosophy about deafness was that to speak was to be human and that deaf people unfortunates should learn to speak in order to fully engage with society. Communication by sign language was mostly prohibited by teachers and often punished. Oralism was perceived as the right way forward. Thus Bell, while genuinely committed to helping deaf people, encouraged speech therapy and lip reading over sign language. He infamously said: We should try ourselves to forget that they are deaf. We should try to teach them to forget they are deaf. His approach is still highly controversial and divisive within the Deaf community to this day. Bells benefactors During this period of his life, Bell became exhausted and unwell trying to juggle teaching with his continuing research into sound. As a result, he largely gave up his private practice to concentrate on his experiments. Bell kept on two deaf pupils: 6 year old Georgie Sanders and 15 year old Mabel Hubbard. They both had wealthy fathers, Thomas Sanders and Gardiner Greene Hubbard, later becoming Bells patrons and friends and financially supporting his research. Bell grew gradually closer to his pupil Mabel, 10 years his junior, and she to him, eventually marrying July 1877. They had four children: two sons who died shortly after birth and two daughters, Elsie and Marian. Bell experiments with improving the telegraph From around the mid-19th century, before Bells invention of the telephone, communication over distance was by means of the electric telegraph, which allowed the wire transmission of text messages more rapidly than the sending of letters. It used an electric current to move magnetic needles to transmit a message in code, translated at the other end by a skilled operator Bell had long been investigating the harmonic telegraph trying to make this conventional telegraphy more sophisticated in order to transmit several messages simultaneously, using tuned electronic metal reeds, to send/receive multiple frequencies along a single wire, avoiding the cost of constructing new lines. This led him to conclude that there might be a way to transmit the human voice by telegraph over a wire an acoustic telegraph. The invention of the telephone Bell did not have sufficient technical knowledge to develop his idea, but a chance meeting with a clever 20 year old electrical engineer Thomas Watson (1854-1934) in a Boston, Massachusetts, electrical shop changed everything Backed by Sanders and Hubbards money (Hubbard wanted to break Western Unions monopoly of the telegraph), in 1875 the pair worked together in Boston on the acoustic telegraph and the telephone. On 14 February 1876, Bells lawyer applied for a patent at the US Patent Office for transmitting vocal or other sounds, even though as yet there was no working telephone. Securing a patent for the telephone On the exact same day that Bell filed for his patent, 14 February, another inventor working on the acoustic telegraph, Elisha Gray, filed for a similar patent. His used water to transmit sound. He also had no working telephone. But it was Bell who was finally granted the patent three weeks later. There is continuing controversy about whose application arrived first and was the most valid, as well as whether Bell misappropriated Grays idea of using liquid as a transmitter three days after being awarded the patent, Bell succeeded in getting his telephone to work. The very first words using his new instrument, as Bell called it, transcribed in his lab notes, were spoken by him to Thomas Watson who was out of earshot in another room: Mr Watson, come here I want to see you. Over the following nearly 20 years, the Bell Telephone Company founded July 1877 (later AT&T), successfully fought off 587 challenges to Bells patent. Bells development of the telephone The American Philadelphia Centennial was an enormous 19th-century world fair showcasing new inventions including typewriters, sewing machines and Heinz ketchup. It opened in May 1876. Here, in public, Bell successfully demonstrated his prototype telephone, proving that it worked. Back in Boston, reunited with Watson, the pair continued experimenting, gradually extending the distance over which the telephone would work. A continuing series of countrywide lectures and demonstrations followed. Interest in the telephone grew rapidly, both with the public and in the wider scientific community. Within three months of Bell, Hubbard, Sanders and Watson founding the Bell Telephone Company, July 1877, to commercialise the telephone, around 1,300 devices were in operation in America. By New Year 1880, there were 30,000. However, Bells interest in the telephone waned in the early 1880s. He was already wealthy. He sold off most of his holdings in the Bell Telephone Company and, by the mid-1880s, his role in the telephone industry was peripheral. In 1888, Bell became a founding member of the National Geographic Society, and was its president three years later. His restlessly inventive mind wanted to keep pushing forwards the boundaries of scientific knowledge: Some of Alexander Bells other inventions In 1888, Bell became a founding member of the National Geographic Society, and was its president three years later. His restlessly inventive mind needed more challenges: He created, among other inventions, a metal detector that was later used to locate bullets and shrapnel in wounded soldiers during the Boer War (1899 to 1902) and the First World War (1914 to 1918), as well as the AEA Silver Dart bi-plane, and designs for winged hydrofoil boats that could zip across water at high speed. He also designed the aileron a key part of aircraft manoeuvrability, helping it bank left or right. The telephone comes to Britain Bells fame spread round the world, to such an extent that he was invited to demonstrate his telephone to Queen Victoria at Osborne House, Isle of Wight, 14 January 1878.","url":"https://heritagecalling.com/2022/07/29/the-story-behind-the-worlds-first-telephone/"}
{"doc_id":"f0529b1c4ed5756b","title":"10 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started ‘Assassin’s Creed Shadows’","content":"While this may be coming a bit late, without bothering to get a review copy, I started Assassins Creed Shadows at the same time as most other people. But given that this is my job, Ive managed to put 40 hours in already, and Ive learned a few things. Here are ten things I wish I knew when I started Assassins Creed Shadows 1) Check The Castle Type Before Invading You can check which type of castle, for Naoe or for Yasuke, the game recommends by looking at its reward, and seeing if its for him or her. A Naoe castle will have more sneaking zones and small entryways, a Yasuke one will have gates to crash and sometimes big boxes to move. However, given how much of a combat monster Yasuke is, I end up using him to blitz through either kind of castle most of the time. That is harder with Naoe. 2) Stay On Your Horse, Avoid The Woods In terms of navigation, this game does not want you to take shortcuts most of the time. I would almost always use your horse and the path tracker when going nearly anywhere. The woods are dense and the hills are steep off the main paths, and it will be more trouble than its worth. Follow the winding directions on horses and you will always get there faster. 3) Dont Forget The Hidden Skill Tree Passive This is easy to miss because it doesnt look like a normal skill slot and you cant put points into it. But at the bottom of every skill tree there will be a circle that shows you that you will get increased damage or health or things like that the more points you put into a tree. Jam points in there to get things like the 50% damage boost I now have on bow and naginata because I make sure to also do points on the left side row of perks, which will account for a lot of them. 4) Dont Forget Double or Triple Unlock Skill Perks - This is easy to miss. A number of upgrades will have a little dot or two above them. This means they can be upgraded multiple times, and for skills especially, these can be big damage boosts, sometimes 100% more damage if you remember to hit those nodes. 5) Always Do Your Contracts Contracts refresh each season, are incredibly easy and usually close by. They give you a lot of upgrade materials for your base, your gear or just money, and if youre short on any of that, never miss them. 6) Dont Bother Smuggling With Scouts That leads me to my next point, dont bother using scouts to tag materials in enemy zones. They dont give you that much, contracts are much more useful, and you should be saving your scouts mainly to find quest locations or occasionally, reset your wanted level. 7) Get Unblockable Counter Gear/Perks While there are many styles of play in the game, I cannot live without giving the ability to parry unblockable attacks to both characters. For Yasuke, thats a chestplate called Protectors Armor found in Nijo Palace in Kyoto you can get very early. For Naoe, its not gear, but a Katana perk, though you need the final row of knowledge point upgrades to unlock that one, which takes a long time. 8) Ditch Old Gear Instead Of Always Upgrading I made the mistake of trying to upgrade all my favorite gear endlessly, but you will quickly run out of materials for that. Do not be afraid to ditch old gear, even legendary gear, for rares or epics because higher levels will give you flat stat boosts that are hugely important. If you cant live without a legendary, fine, focus on upgrading that one. 9) Get Legendary Blacksmith Mods This requires a max Blacksmith upgrade at base, but it lets you take legendary mods from gear and put them in other gears slots. For instance, that unblockable parry perk from Yasukes armor can then be put into any other armor along with the original base perk. 10) Dont Forget To Transmog This is easy to miss, but making your guys look awesome is a great aspect of the game. You can delete gear and still have those styles unlocked. Most legendary gear will have its own unique look, but even lower tier gear can be some of the best in the game (the mask everyone always asks me about for one).

On Thursday, developer Rockstar Games announced the game has been delayed to Nov. GTA 6 had previously been targeted for a 2025 release date before it was originally delayed to May 26, 2026. GTA 6 has been highly anticipated, in part because the previous entry in the series was released in September 2013. The 13-year gap between releases is the longest the series has ever experienced. Set in the fictional state of Leonida, GTA 6 follows the adventures of criminal couple Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos. Players will be able to control both characters as they roam Leonida, which includes a return to the titular metropolis of 2002's Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. As of 2025, GTA V was the second-highest-selling video game of all time, with publisher Take Two Interactive saying the game had moved 220 million units.","url":"https://www.espn.com/gaming/story/_/id/46874180/grand-theft-auto-6-vi-release-date-delay"}
{"doc_id":"9362e23544a9b267","title":"Grand Theft Auto VI - Rockstar Games","content":"Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive. Jason wants an easy life, but things just keep getting harder. Jason grew up around grifters and crooks. After a stint in the Army trying to shake off his troubled teens, he found himself in the Keys doing what he knows best, working for local drug runners. It might be time to try something new. If anything happens, I'm right behind you. Another day in paradise, right? Meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him. Jason knows how he'd like it to turn out but right now, it's hard to tell. Lucias father taught her to fight as soon as she could walk. Life has been coming at her swinging ever since. Fighting for her family landed her in the Leonida Penitentiary. Sheer luck got her out. Lucias learned her lesson only smart moves from here. More than anything, Lucia wants the good life her mom has dreamed of since their days in Liberty City but instead of half-baked fantasies, Lucia is prepared to take matters into her own hands. The only thing that matters is who you know and what you got. Fresh out of prison and ready to change the odds in her favor, Lucias committed to her plan no matter what it takes. A life with Jason could be her way out. Only in Leonida When the sun fades and the neon glows, everyone has something to gain and more to lose. What if everything on the internet was true? Jasons friend and a fellow associate of Brians, Cal feels safest hanging at home, snooping on Coast Guard comms with a few beers and some private browser tabs open. There are way too many birds flying around in perfect formation. The psychopaths are in charge. Cal is at the low tide of America and happy there. Casual paranoia loves company, but his friend Jason has bigger plans. Tour a few of the must-see destinations across the sunshine state. It's all about heart the Jack of Hearts. Boobie is a local Vice City legend and acts like it. One of the few to transform his time in the streets into a legitimate empire spanning real estate, a strip club, and a recording studio Boobie's all smiles until it's time to talk business. The club money pay for the studio, and the drug money pay for it all. Boobie might seem like he's just out for himself, but it's his partnership with the young aspiring music mogul Dre'Quan for Only Raw Records that he's most invested in now they just need a hit. Records Dre'Quan was always more of a hustler than a gangster. Even when he was dealing on the streets to make ends meet, breaking into music was the goal. Dancers are like my A&Rs. If the record's a hit, DJs gonna be spinnin' it. You're with the label now. Now that he's signed the Real Dimez, Dre'Quan's days of booking acts into Boobie's strip club might be numbered as he sets his sights on the Vice City scene. Bae-Luxe and Roxy aka Real Dimez have been friends since high school girls with the savvy to turn their time shaking down local dealers into cold, hard cash via spicy rap tracks and a relentless social media presence. All my dimes in this club. Meet my twin, make it a dub. One hit away from fame. An early hit single with local rapper DWNPLY took Real Dimez to new heights. Now, after five years and a whole lot of trouble, theyre signed to Only Raw Records, hoping lightning can strike twice. Confidence, charm, and cunning Rauls a seasoned bank robber always on the hunt for talent ready to take the risks that bring the biggest rewards. Life is full of surprises, my friend. I think we'd all be wise to remember that. A professional adapts. Raul's recklessness raises the stakes with every score. Sooner or later, his crew will have to double down or pull their chips from the table. Nothing better than a Mudslide at sunset. Brian's a classic drug runner from the golden age of smuggling in the Keys. Still moving product through his boat yard with his third wife, Lori, Brian's been around long enough to let others do his dirty work. I hauled so much grass in that plane, I could make the state of Leonida levitate. Looks like a Leonida beach bum moves like a great white shark.

{"doc_id":"a10cf69ddd1c09b6","title":"President Donald J. Trump","content":"After a landslide election victory in 2024, President Donald J. Trump is returning to the White House to build upon his previous successes and use his mandate to reject the extremist policies of the radical left while providing tangible quality of life improvements for the American people. This includes putting a stop to endless wars, defending our nations borders, and unleashing the potential of the American economy, affording ALL Americans the opportunity to pursue THEIR version of the American dream. In his first administration, President Trump passed record-setting tax cuts and regulation cuts, achieved energy independence, replaced NAFTA with the United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, invested $2 trillion to completely rebuild the Military, launched the Space Force, obliterated the ISIS Caliphate, achieved a major breakthrough for peace in the Middle East, passed the most significant Veterans Affairs reforms in half a century, confirmed over 250 federal judges, including 3 Supreme Court Justices, signed bipartisan Criminal Justice Reform, lowered drug prices, protected Medicare and Social Security, and secured our nations borders in his first four years in office. This was only the beginning. Trump defines the American success story. Throughout his life he has continually set the standards of business and entrepreneurial excellence, especially in real estate, sports, and entertainment. President Trump built on his success in private life when he entered into politics and public service. He remarkably won the Presidency in his first ever run for any political office. He won a second time despite several assassination attempts and the unprecedented weaponization of law fare against him. Time after time President Trump has defied the odds because he fundamentally believes in the exceptionalism of the American spirit and wants to see our great country succeed. A graduate of the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School of Finance, President Trump followed in his fathers footsteps into the world of real estate development, making his mark in New York City. There, the Trump name soon became synonymous with the most prestigious of addresses in Manhattan and, subsequently, throughout the world. President Trump is also an accomplished author. He has written more than fourteen bestsellers. His first book, The Art of the Deal, is considered a business classic. President Trump has five children, Barron, Don Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany, as well as 11 grandchildren.","url":"https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/"}

Thousands of supporters gathered outside Dhakas main airport and along the road leading to her house to welcome Zia, who has spent recent years in and out of hospital. She was seen sitting in a wheelchair at the airport. The 78-year-old BNP leader smiled as she repeatedly raised her right hand to receive greetings. A three-time prime minister twice for full five-year terms and once for just a few months and Hasinas chief political rival was convicted in 2018 and sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison on charges of fund embezzlement from charitable trusts. The charges were brought during Hasinas rule and were widely viewed by the BNP as politically motivated. In January, Bangladeshs Supreme Court acquitted Zia, overturning a 10-year sentence and clearing her of any wrongdoing. The ruling followed a separate November 2024 acquittal in another high-profile case, in which Zia had been accused of misappropriating more than $260,000 from a second trust during her last term in office. Election date While Zia had already been released from prison, her arrival in Bangladesh will intensify calls on the interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, to announce a clear date for national elections. Bangladeshs authorities have pledged to hold elections by either December this year or June next year, depending on the pace of reforms. Zia is the widow of former military ruler Ziaur Rahman, assassinated in 1981, and became the countrys first female prime minister, and one of the first women world leaders from South Asia. Zias elder son, Tarique Rahman, leads the BNP as acting chief from exile in London. Hasina, the last elected prime minister, is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who led Bangladeshs war of independence from Pakistan in 1971.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/6/bangladeshs-khaleda-zia-returns-elections"}
{"doc_id":"4fbc71bd9fd3671f","title":"Khaleda Zia | Biography & Facts | Britannica","content":"Khaleda Zia News Khaleda Zia (born August 15, 1945, Dinjpur, East Bengal, India [now in Bangladesh]) is a Bangladeshi politician who served as prime minister of Bangladesh in 199196 and 200106. She was the first woman to serve as prime minister of the country, and she governed during a period of natural disasters, economic distress, and civil unrest. Khaleda was the third of five children born to Taiyaba and Iskandar Majumdar, a businessman. In 1960 she passed the government matriculation exam and later attended Surendranath College in Dinjpur. In 1959 she married Zia ur-Rahman, a leader in the fight for the independence of Bangladesh, then part of Pakistan. During the struggle in 1971 she was kept under house arrest, though she remained largely uninterested in politics, even after her husband became president of Bangladesh in 1977. After her husband was assassinated in 1981 by military officers, she became politically active, and in 1984 she assumed the leadership of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Khaleda was arrested repeatedly during the dictatorship of Hussein Mohammad Ershad in the 1980s, but in 1991 she led the opposition to victory and became prime minister. During Khaledas first term she attempted to tackle the countrys dire economic problems by privatizing industry and encouraging private investment; her government also focused on improving the countrys educational system and expanding the economic opportunities available to women. Her efforts were hampered, however, by a cyclone in 1991 that killed more than 130,000 people and caused more than $2 billion in damage. In February 1996 she overwhelmingly won a second term in office, but her victory was tainted by an opposition-led boycott of the election; heeding the call of opposition groups, which claimed that the government would rig the outcome in its favour, roughly nine-tenths of eligible voters abstained. After a wave of strikes and protests, she resigned the following month. In 2001 Khaleda regained power, promising to eliminate both corruption and terrorism. Both, however, remained problematic throughout her second term. She stepped down at the end of 2006, passing authority to a caretaker administration until elections could be held. - In full: - Khaleda Zia ur-Rahman - Ne: - Khaleda Majumdar - Born: - August 15, 1945, Dinjpur, East Bengal, India [now in Bangladesh] (age 80) - Title / Office: - prime minister (2001-2006), Bangladesh - prime minister (1991-1996), Bangladesh - Political Affiliation: - Bangladesh Nationalist Party In January 2007 a state of emergency was declared in Bangladesh, and an army-backed government took power. It subsequently launched an antigraft campaign, and in September Khaleda was arrested on corruption charges. In 2014 she and others went on trial for embezzling funds intended for a charity. She was convicted in February 2018 and began serving a five-year sentence, which rendered her unable to contest elections later in the year. Khaleda denied any wrongdoing, claiming the verdict was politically motivated. In October she was convicted on additional charges of graft, while her February conviction was upheld and the sentence was extended to 10 years. That same month her son was sentenced in absentia to life in prison. Khaledas health began to decline in April 2019, and in March 2020 she was released from prison on a temporary basis while undergoing medical treatment.","url":"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Khaleda-Zia"}

Bangladesh has released Begum Khaleda Zia, the chair of the main opposition party, from house arrest, the presidents office announced.

She has denied the charges against her. Zia was an archrival of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, 76, who resigned and fled the country on Monday. On Tuesday, President Mohammed Shahabuddin announced Zias release from house arrest and dissolved parliament after calls from the student-led national movement. Zia had led the BNP since 1981 after her husband, then-president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in an attempted military coup. She became Bangladeshs first woman prime minister a decade later. Despite having ruled between 1991 and 1996 and from 2001 to 2006, Zias terms in office were marred by corruption allegations. As part of a deal to allow Zia to resume political life, her two sons also accused of corruption during her second term relocated to the United Kingdom. The announcement of her release came after the army chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, was meeting student leaders to discuss the formation of an interim government that is expected to hold elections soon after it takes over. Meanwhile, the countrys key police association on Tuesday apologised for actions against innocent students during the crackdown on protesters and demanded the release of its jailed officers. Until the security of every member of the police is secured, we are declaring a strike, the Bangladesh police association said in a statement. It argued its officers had been forced to open fire, and that they had been cast as the villain. The families of political prisoners jailed in Bangladesh under Hasina waited desperately for news of their relatives, as some of those missing were released. Among the most prominent of those released on Tuesday was opposition activist and lawyer Ahmad Bin Quasem, a British-educated barrister son of Mir Quasem Ali, the former leader of Jamaat-e-Islami who was hanged in 2016 after his final appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court. Security forces during Hasinas rule were accused of detaining tens of thousands of opposition activists, killing hundreds in extrajudicial encounters, and disappearing their leaders and supporters. Human Rights Watch last year said security forces had committed more than 600 enforced disappearances since Hasina came to power in 2009, and nearly 100 people remain unaccounted for. Hasinas government denied the allegations, saying some of those reported missing drowned in the Mediterranean while trying to reach Europe. We need answers, Sanjida Islam Tulee, coordinator of Mayer Daak, told the AFP news agency. The group, whose name translates as The Call of the Mothers, has been campaigning for the release of detained people.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/6/bangladesh-frees-hasina-rival-khaleda-zia-from-house-arrest"}
{"doc_id":"2b9747095a0d9c68","title":"Political transition in Bangladesh may move the country away from a dark chapter, but risks of mass violence against civilians remain - United States Holocaust Memorial Museum","content":"In November 2017, the Simon-Skjodt Center released a report that detailed concerns about the risk of mass atrocities in Bangladesh, with a particular focus on the countrys December 2018 elections. The report found that the risk of mass atrocities centered around political competition between the ruling Awami League party, led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) opposition alliance. Some violent incidents occurred around the elections, but mass killings of civilians did not. The Awami Leagues electoral victory and consolidation of political power, and the shrinking space for political opposition and civil society, however, threatened the future of democracy in the country. In the summer of 2024, when student protesters took to the streets to oppose government policies and express growing dissatisfaction, the Bangladeshi government responded violently. The governments response led to growing public pressure for change. On August 5, 2024, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country. Days later, an interim government was formed, headed by Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus. Ali Riaz, an expert on Bangladeshi politics at Illinois State University, shares his analysis of mass atrocity risks facing civilians in Bangladesh after the transition. The Simon-Skjodt Center previously found that mass atrocity risks in Bangladesh were rooted in political competition between the Awami League and the BNP. In your opinion, what are the most significant risks today? The situation has further deteriorated since your last analysis, as the politics in Bangladesh has become more polarized in the previous years under the Sheikh Hasina regime. Hasinas Awami League party deepened political and social divisions to help it dominate politics. As the Hasina regime became more dependent on brute force, it used the state apparatuses and its party activists to confront any dissent. Law enforcement agencies and Bangladesh Awami League (AL) activists killed approximately 500 people and injured thousands more between mid-July and August 5, 2024. Revamping the law enforcement agencies and holding members of the security forces accountable for crimes will help regain respect and minimize the distance between law enforcement and the citizens. But the structural impact of the violent episode will be long-lasting. Two camps will emergethose who participated and supported the uprising, and those who will remain loyal to the past regime. Such a schism can fuel risks of group-targeted violence. Do you see any scenarios in which civilians could face large-scale, targeted attacks in the near future? Which scenarios do you think may be most likely or most concerning? Ahead of the downfall of the regime in August 2024, Bangladesh had experienced the most brutal crackdown and widespread violence since the countrys independence in 1971. The ferocity and rapidity of the spread of violence was unimaginable even though Bangladesh has experienced past bouts of political violence. The way the state apparatuses were used against unarmed civilian protesters between July 16 and August 5, it seemed like a war between the state and its people. After the downfall of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the violence took a different shape as police, AL supporters and some members of minority communities faced the fury of angry people. The absence of police on the street and mayhem provided opportunities to settle personal scores as well. But there also seem to have been coordinated attempts by the AL activists to unleash violence to create panic and destabilize the situation. These could be precursors of large-scale violence against civilians in the coming weeks and months. Desperate AL supporters, encouraged by their leaders within and outside the country, may try to demonstrate that the party is not a spent force. The most worrying scenario is that sporadic incidents of violence continue over months and devolve into conflicts between state security forces and AL activists. I am also afraid that members of the Hindu community may be attacked, which in addition to the direct harm to victims can be spun by political opportunists as examples of the rise of anti-Hindu Islamist forces and the failure of the interim government to provide safety. Approximately one million Rohingya refugees from Burma have sought safety in Bangladesh. Would you expect any changes regarding insecurity or risks facing Rohingya refugees as a result of the political turmoil in Dhaka? The political upheaval, prevailing uncertainties, and change in the government are unlikely to have any near-term impact on the Rohingya refugees. Two factors will shield the Rohingya refugees from being embroiled in the political situation. First, the interim governments approach towards the Rohingya refugees will be similar to that of the previous government. Professor Yunus has promised to continue support to Rohingya refugees. Second, international organizations such as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization of Migration (IOM), can continue providing services and will not become involved in domestic politics. In recent months, violence in the camps has increased due to turf wars between various groups (namely the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army and the Rohingya Solidarity Organization) and the volatile situation across the border. These developments are not connected to the political situation in Bangladesh. However, one unfortunate impact is that political changes will shift the focus away from the plight of the Rohingya, who require long-term support after the coup in Burma in 2021 and as the ongoing conflict in Arakan State makes repatriation elusive. What should policymakers and scholars watch for in the coming weeks and months? For the past 15 years, law enforcement agencies have committed gross violations of human rights and enjoyed impunity. Those who were in commanding positions must be held accountable. Policymakers should closely watch whether the interim government succeeds in preventing any kind of reprisal while bringing perpetrators to justice. Structural changes in institutions are necessary to end the culture of impunity and establish rule of law. Policymakers and scholars should monitor whether such moves are taken, and where necessary, the international community needs to offer help. An important aspect that Bangladesh watchers should follow is how the supporters of the deposed Hasina regimeboth in Bangladesh and in India behave in the coming months. If they succeed in creating instability through violent activities, it may engender a cycle of reprisal, and the country may plunge into a low-intensity conflict, which in turn can pose serious risks to civilians.

{"doc_id":"e8614fec0b6fe029","title":"Bangladesh Is Well-Positioned to Build a New Political Area. Can It Seize the Moment? | Carnegie Endowment for International Peace","content":"The dramatic collapse of former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasinas government has created extraordinary churn and uncertainty at home, in the region, and geopolitically. A student-driven movement led to widespread demonstrations that triggered a crisis within the regime, most notably the militarys refusal to repress the protests. Hasina is now in India, and an interim government is in place in Dhaka, advised by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. External observers are watching developments carefully to understand what trajectory Bangladesh might take. The most important questions are domestic. The aftermath of political revolutions can go in numerous directions, from civil war to the consolidation of a new and broadly accepted political system, and everything in between. Hasinas regime was what political scientists refer to as competitive authoritarian: there were elections, but her Awami League political party used the state apparatus to undermine the opposition and tilt the playing field to its advantage. The sudden end of that configuration has thrown the entire political system into a state of flux. The interim government is pursuing reforms of key sectors of the state, including the electoral system, the police, and the constitution. The good news is that Bangladesh is better positioned for stability than many other post-regime change cases. A state structure is in place, even if hollowed out and in need of serious reform. The comparative lack of large-scale regional or ethnolinguistic cleavages avoids some of the sources of state failure and political polarization witnessed in other contexts (though violence in tribal areas is a worrying development). Labor mobilization, which has been a regular occurrence in recent months, is generally not a source of political breakdown in these cases. In comparative perspective, Bangladesh has solid ingredients for successfully building a new political arena. Nevertheless, there are serious dangers. The most immediate challenge is the breakdown in basic state functioning, especially law and order (as Yunus has acknowledged). Insecurity creates an opening for vigilantism and mob violence, and it undermines political stability and economic investment. The mobilization of anti-Hindu and anti-blasphemy sentiment is a particularly potent potential driver. A key question moving forward will be how political parties and state institutions will deal with the relationship between Islam and Bangladeshi nationalism. The biggest open question is what political reforms will look like, how and in what sequence they will be implemented, and when and in what manner new elections will be held. Historically, this kind of transition can collapse in two ways. Elite power struggles, including coups, autocratic seizures of power by civilian leaders, and interparty deadlock, can stall the creation of a democratic post-revolutionary government. This can lead to some form of autocracy or even state breakdown. Alternatively, bottom-up discontentranging from mass protests to political violencecan undermine post-revolutionary governments ability to construct functional new institutions by causing a crisis of legitimacy. These challenges can also become dangerously entangled: for instance, communal or street violence can provide a motivation (or pretext) for leaders to double down on authoritarianism in the name of public order. In the face of these dangers, Bangladeshs current configuration of political forces, with an interim, unelected government partnering with the army, will need to make clear political progress with transparent goals and timelines. It will also need to make decisions about how best to spur economic development. Bangladesh has been suffering economically since the onset of the pandemic, and a lack of economic opportunity was a key source of discontent with Hasinas government. The summers instability contributed to further challenges in attracting investment. While the sacrifices and success of the anti-Hasina movement have provided the interim government with initial legitimacy, the longer it holds office, the more it will need to show economic benefits and political progress. If evidence of forward movement is replaced with a sense of political stagnation, the government will face dissension from within and criticism from citizens about the appropriate timing and structure of elections, which political changes are democratically legitimate, and how political and economic power should be allocated. For instance, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)the Awami Leagues longtime rivalhas articulated a different timeline for elections than the Bangladesh Army (and the fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami), which could lead to conflict over the right time for elections. Similarly, the status of Hasinas Awami League in a future election and how to punish those responsible for rights abuses could become objects of debate and disagreement. The political leadership needs to be attentive to the ways that a transition to a new and effective democratic system could become bogged down. Furthermore, Bangladesh is enmeshed in a complicated foreign policy environment. India was dismayed by the collapse of Hasinas government, and many in India are deeply concerned about anti-Hindu violence and the prospect of greater Islamization of Bangladeshi state and society. They are also reminded of past Bangladeshi support for insurgents operating in remote pockets of northeastern India. On the other hand, many Bangladeshis view India as having been an unconditional supporter of the Hasina regime and its abuses and are in no mood to listen to Indian lectures about human rights and minority protection. Of late, India has been able to recover from foreign policy missteps that made it an attractive domestic political target in Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Maldives, but its deep association with Hasina (as well as her current, even if temporary, residence in India) makes it harder to quickly and credibly pivot. In turn, Bangladesh cannot afford to alienate India; its sheer size and proximity provide it with leverage that Bangladeshs ties to China and the West cannot fully offset. The interim government hopes to establish a stable new equilibrium in India-Bangladesh relations that does not privilege India as much as under Hasinas rule. Bangladesh will also need to deal with the escalating civil war in Myanmar and especially the extraordinary level of conflict in Myanmars Rakhine state, which borders Bangladesh. Refugee flows and the growing power of the Arakan Armyan ethnic armed group in Myanmar that now controls much of Rakhineboth will present political challenges that the interim government will need to navigate. Finally, broader geopolitical issues are at play. Disagreements between the United States and India over how to handle the Hasina governmentespecially in the run-up to Bangladeshs 2024 election and its aftermath revealed real differences in the countries strategic assessments. The United States sees the collapse of Hasinas rule as evidence that its diagnosis of the regimes underlying instability and growing reliance on repression was ultimately correct. Some in India, however, see the foreign hand of the United States in her fall. From Americas perspective, helping Yunus and the interim government rebuild democracy and keep China at bay is a key priority. Many in India view this approach either as providing a dangerously nave opening to Islamist influence or as a cunning strategy for limiting Indian influence in the region. These differences will not roll back U.S.-India strategic convergence, but they are a crucial reminder that the United States and India reside in different neighborhoods and have different interests and perceptions. Both the United States and India are concerned about Chinas influence in Bangladesh. Hasina had successfully balanced close ties to New Delhi with a strong relationship with Beijing, but China has nimbly adapted to regime change. For the United States, advancing good governance and functional democracy in Bangladesh, ideally under the rule of relatively secular and pro-Western political forces, is seen as the best way to contain Chinese influence. Yet it is important for Washington to recognize that Dhaka has shown little inclination to become part of Americas China containment strategy. As in Nepal and elsewhere in South Asia, the United States will be most effective at providing distinctive complements, not direct substitutes, to what China has to offer, while being realistic about Bangladeshs desire to maintain good ties with all major powers.

It didnt take me 26 hours to unlock him, but even still, Ive spent so much time investing in Naoe that Yasuke is effectively unplayable to me. I dread the story missions where Im forced to play him. This is a ninja game to me, not a samurai game. It doesnt help that you spend so much time with Naoe from the start. Once you get used to being a ninja crawling through bushes and lurking on rooftops, its really hard to go back to the more traditional Assassins Creed hero that is Yasuke. His style is exactly what I havent liked about the series since Assassins Creed 3. He can sneak around and climb walls, but hes built to brawl. The problem is that combat in Assassins Creed Shadows is pretty clunky. With Naoe, the point is to avoid directly clashing with enemies, and that works in the games favor. Ubisoft has wall-climbing and traversal mastered at this point, so castles turn into 3D puzzles when you play stealthily. When I prepare to clean out a base, I plan out my route based on whats in front of me: Bushes are checkpoints to stop and observe patrolling guards, dark rooms are possible escape locations, and rooftops are perches to pinpoint my targets. And all of this shifts based on the time of day and how visible Ill be while crawling around. Stealth in Assassins Creed Shadows is all about execution and adapting to whatever happens when you inevitably screw up. Its actually fun when things go wrong because you have to play to Naoes strengths as a tiny ninja who isnt equipped to take on multiple enemies swinging at her well, as long as youre not using the weapon that breaks the game. As soon as youre caught, everything in the environment can be your lifeline against a squad of samurai hunting for you. All of this nicely complements how beautifully rendered the world is. Assassins Creed Shadows is one of the best-looking games Ive ever played, and its not all for show. Naoe has to rely on the world itself to succeed. Theres nothing better than piercing your sword through shoji to assassinate an enemy and see sunlight pour into the room. Its a risk that can get you caught, but its also an impressive example of how the hyperrealistic graphics have a material effect on how you interact with the world. Yasuke is encouraged to ignore all of that to pulverize enemies head-on. It can be a nice break from tiptoeing around, but it flattens Assassins Creed Shadows into a mediocre action game. Melee combat is spammy and weightless and only seems to be a good way to save yourself some time clearing out a castle. It just isnt satisfying to me to ram my way through a series of enemies until I get to a treasure chest. Theres no real strategy to it because hes made to bull rush through every encounter. Naoe, however, is exactly what I like about stealth games. Im patient, but not so patient that I can endure slowly picking off every enemy on the way to my objective. So I simply dont, and push myself to keep moving and adapting to what happens on the fly. This adds a layer of tension that fighting as Yasuke lacks as you balance not getting caught while trying to squeeze your way straight toward your target. I like Yasuke as a character, and his friendship with Naoe is endearing, but I find the power fantasy of playing a tank rather empty in a game that is set up for a much slower, methodical approach. All I ever want to do is play the ninja revenge story that no other Assassins Creed has given me.","url":"https://www.polygon.com/gaming/560199/assassins-creed-shadows-solo-protagonist-naoe-yasuke/"}

Although blockchain has found many applications outside of cryptocurrency, many of its features are not well suited to common data management applications. The added trust of distributed ledgers is a valuable feature, providing greatly simplified auditability and verification of actions among multiple parties in applications such as supply chain and others, but there are tradeoffs. Blockchain's hash-based integrity verification provides trust, at the cost of an inability to delete or update records, leading to design complications that would not arise with conventional database management systems. Similarly, the sequencing guarantees of blockchain consensus protocols are needed for cryptocurrency in the absence of a universal timestamp. Moreover, actions within the distributed ledger must be connected with other actions in the real world, through accurate timestamps. We are developing a new architecture that provides the trust features of blockchains, with characteristics that allow for simpler designs and greater practicality in conventional data management problems. We believe this alternative can lead to new approaches to incorporating trust into distributed systems applications. Blockchain and Economic Development: Hype vs. Reality Center for Global Development - July 2017 Increasing attention is being paid to the potential of blockchain technology to address long-standing challenges related to economic development.

{"doc_id":"7cce5ea0691afd0f","title":"3 Ways in which Blockchain can Help Education Industry","content":"It is not long when Blockchain was a buzz word and every business out there was rushing to hire resources for Ethereum development (Ethereum being one of the most popular Blockchains). But with time, the people and industry have matured, and now businesses emphasis on getting comprehensive Blockchain consulting services first before deciding to invest in the solution development. Blockchain is a network of distributed ledgers, where information is stored in groups (known as Blocks) in the form of cryptographic hashes A cryptographic hash function can convert information of any size into a unique fixed length alphanumeric string. Two different information pieces can never have the same cryptographic hash. Even, if a small change is made in the information, it will lead to a different cryptographic hash. Different types of Blockchains group a specific number of hashes in the form of a block and each block has a reference to the previous and next block, thus forming an immutable chain of a group of hashes connected with each other. Problems in education industry and how Blockchain can solve them The education industry is not well connected, and the information is stored in silos. It relies heavily on information published in physical form. Thus, the information is prone to duplication and tempering. Some of the major challenges are: 1. Verification of certificates With so many advanced image editing software available, a paper-based degree or certificate can be easily reproduced or edited. Differentiating between a doctored/fake document and the original is almost impossible. Although most of the certificates/degrees have a unique identification number. Availability of the means to audit and verify this unique number is less or completely missing. Businesses hire third-party verification services provider to authenticate these certificates/degrees which cost considerably. The verification process itself is long and time-consuming resulting in unnecessary delays in the hiring process. Solution Educational institutes can opt for Ethereum development to build a network of institutes on Blockchain. This network can be joined by other corporate businesses that can have only the access rights. Every transaction in such a network gets recorded with a time stamp and the details of the transaction are stored in the form of a cryptographic hash that makes making changes in the recorded information almost impossible. Such a Blockchain-based network is write-once only and any new information can only be appended i.e. information cant be deleted or edited. Even the owner of the information can only append the information, and it is easy to track who made the changes and when. This network can be utilized to publish degrees/certificates digitally. All the information related to a persons profile can be recorded in the form of a smart contract a feature of Ethereum Blockchain. Educational Institutes can publish certificates/degrees on the network and the information can be added in the smart contract. Whenever a piece of new information (a new certificate or degree) gets added to the smart contract, the person needs to verify the information. After verification, it becomes a permanent history of the persons profile. Every member of the network including businesses will get automated alerts initiated by the smart contract for new additions or updates made in the persons profile. This streamlines the verification process, eliminating the need of the third party verification services. But in the real world scenario, the third party verification companies can themselves utilize such networks to provide better services. Proof of original work & authorship In higher studies, research work plays an important role. Postgraduate students and scholars often publish research work. Also, many of these researches are sponsored by corporate entities. To check whether the work is original or copied, universities and journals take services of online plagiarism tools which cost them thousands of dollars. Solution In a Blockchain network (as explained earlier), each research paper can be stored with a unique identifier. Also, the text file containing the research work can be fed into an algorithm known as SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm) which generates unique 256-bit hashes for added security. Thus, it is impossible to make copies of the information and only people with the right credential can access the information. Additionally, it is easy to prove the ownership of the work. Cross-border payments Many students cross borders for getting a better education. They face many hurdles while transferring money across borders for paying fees and other educational expenses. In international transfers, the transaction fees is high and there is no visibility as to when the receiver will get the funds. Solution By developing a cryptocurrency that can be exchanged for availing various educational services and for making fee payments, the education institutes can settle the payments faster. Moreover, this cryptocurrency can be utilized for rewarding the outstanding performing students automatically via smart contracts when they achieve certain goals, who can then utilize the received funds to make fee payments or avail other educational services. Conclusion Education Industry is ripe for Blockchain implementation. The benefits of implementing Blockchain outshines the cost involved in the development by a huge margin. However, to utilize this technology to the full potential, a technology partner who can provide comprehensive Blockchain consulting services is essential.

{"doc_id":"ab94e6866cb3c64f","title":"Dancing with Daffodils  – Farming Innovation Programme","content":"Unlocking environmental and economic benefits for the dairy sector through the use of novel additives from a scalable daffodil opportunity. The challenge Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ruminants represents a major challenge to the UK farming industry, with agriculture accounting for 12%1 of total GHG emissions and 49%2 of total UK methane emissions in 2022. With regulatory and industry pushes to reduce GHGs and methane output, solutions are therefore urgent. There are a number of different strategies to reduce methane emissions, including nutritional strategies, animal genetics, and whole-farm systematic approaches through improved stock productivity. Of the nutritional solutions, results can be inconsistent and have yet to tackle the associated issues such as improving the efficiency of protein utilisation. The answer in daffodils This innovative new project will research, test and develop a solution using a novel additive extracted from daffodils that could not only be capable of decreasing ruminant methane emissions, but also improve protein utilisation bringing environmental and economic benefits to the sector. Led by high-quality feed specialists Rumenco, with support from bioresearchers Agroceutical and a consortium of experts, growers and researchers, the project will work to identify the opportunity that exists to help tackle this huge GHG issue for UK dairy farmers. The consortium allows different unique skills to come together, including SRUCs ability to measure methane from individual cows, the development of a farm-based methane measurement device, daffodil producers and extraction specialists, and the UK Agri-Tech Centre to ensure knowledge exchange for the sector. Project scope This project started in June 2023 with a focus on the extraction and analysis of an alkaloid compound from daffodils. Preliminary work has shown this compound to potentially reduce rumen methane production along with improving feed protein usage efficiency. The key objectives are to develop a unique, innovative product that increases efficiency and sustainability of ruminant meat and milk, whilst also reducing the carbon footprint and protein-imports in the supply chain. This will involve preparing and testing the use of the additive in ruminant feed, including optimal dosage to maximise potential. The project will also identify and assess the opportunity for scaling of daffodil growth as a cash crop in the UK to meet the potential demand that could result from successful demonstration of the additive. As part of the work, the project will therefore consider the potential for a local, sustainable and resilient daffodil growing sector across the UK. Its all part of creating a more efficient food system, explains Kevin Stephens, Founder and Director at Agroceutical: A significant proportion of agricultural land is not suitable for growing food crops and therefore we need to use ruminant livestock to convert the grass into something the increasing human population can consume. Changing the amount of food animals require and the volume of emissions they produce is a significant challenge, but one we really hope the daffodil can help tackle. As the project progresses, we are also keen to continue to develop the extraction and processing methods, to create a more efficient system that can be scaled up. Traditionally, these kinds of chemical processes have relied on throwing power at it to make it work, but we want to reinvent the scientific methods to work with nature more effectively to deliver the results we need. Since inception, the project has initially been focused on optimising extraction techniques and the analysis of the additives potential. With work completing on these tasks and initial results being reviewed, attention is now turning to the preparation stage for how the additive can be effectively introduced to ruminant food. Whats next? As the project progresses, work will focus on demonstrating the key benefits of the opportunity for a variety of stakeholders, including daffodil growers, ruminant farmers, feed manufacturers, and the dairy sector more widely. The partners aim to showcase real-world data around the additives effectiveness on protein utilisation, whilst also targeting the wider problem of the environmental impact of dairy farming, through the reduction in methane production. Achieving these results will then aid communication and engagement efforts that will be key to the wider uptake and commercialisation plans of the project partners. As Alison Bond, Technical Services Manager at Rumenco, explains, this is part of the aim to put the UK in a leading global position: The UK benefits from the perfect climate for daffodil growth, and faces limited international competition from countries with the same conditions. Success in this project will be a valuable step towards creating an international market and supply chain for these additives and food products. With governments seemingly destined to incentivise and support low-methane farming systems due to environmental pressures, the benefits of a UK-led solution will be substantial. The funding has been vital in giving us the platform to take the concept forward and back our efforts to bring novel science into the food sector. Furthermore, having access to a wider group of experts in Defra and Innovate UK not only helps keep the project on track with our aims, but also supports other areas of networking and regulatory guidance as we progress. 1 and 2: UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions National Statistics 1990 to 2022.","url":"https://farminginnovation.ukri.org/case-studies/dancing-with-daffodils/"}

Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency that was famed for its computer encryption, preventing many from making fraudulent transactions online. Considering the benefits that cryptocurrencies could offer to the fintech industry, new cryptocurrencies are launched, often than before. And the result is that there are over 1000 cryptocurrencies available, while many are still in the progress phase. The reason behind the popularity of digital currencies is their diverse use cases. Today, the applications of cryptocurrencies are not limited to just securing transactions or verifying transfer of assets. In fact, they are used by startups for raising funds, which was earlier restricted to Initial Public Offering (IPO), venture capital, or angel investment (along with their respective constraints). Cryptocurrencies are used as a token for launching Blockchain based Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The possibility of getting high returns on investing in cryptocurrency market has resulted in huge interest of investors. Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S. had a rise in number of users from 0.4 million (in Jan 2017) to 4.3 million (in Dec 2017).

{"doc_id":"c33091626406922a","title":"Nipocalimab, the first and only investigational treatment to be granted U.S. FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe Sjögren’s disease, has now received Fast Track designation","content":"SPRING HOUSE, Pa., (March 18, 2025) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted investigational nipocalimab Fast Track designation (FTD) for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe Sjgrens disease (SjD), having previously been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation (BTD) for the investigational therapy late last year. Currently, no advanced therapies are approved to treat this disease. Building upon the BTD, which nipocalimab is the first and only therapeutic to receive for SjD, the U.S. FDAs FTD is also designed to accelerate the delivery of new therapeutics to patients by facilitating the development and expediting the review of drugs that demonstrate the potential to treat serious conditions and help address unmet needs for serious or life-threatening conditions. This marks an additional important step forward in our efforts to bring meaningful advancements to people living with Sjgrens disease, a serious and debilitating condition. We look forward to continuing to work closely with the FDA to advance the clinical development of nipocalimab and potentially provide a much-needed treatment option for this community, said Katie Abouzahr, M.D., Vice President, Autoantibody Portfolio and Maternal Fetal Disease Area Leader, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. There are no FDA-approved treatments that directly address the underlying causes of this complex disease, associated with serious health consequences including chronic dryness of moisture producing glands that may lead to systemic complications such as joint pain, fatigue and inflammation in multiple organ systems.1,2,3 These systemic complications can lead to an increased risk of mortality and associated health conditions, including a 20 times greater risk of developing B-cell lymphomas when compared to the general population.1,4 The Phase 2 DAHLIAS study, the results of which were presented last year, represented the first-ever positive results of an investigational FcRn blocker as a potential targeted therapy in SjD. The study achieved the primary endpoint in the 15 mg/kg Q2W nipocalimab group, showing a greater than 70% relative average improvement in systemic disease activity at Week 24 compared to placebo and IgG reductions of more than 77%.5 Trends of improvement were similarly observed across multiple secondary endpoints.5 Safety and tolerability were consistent with other nipocalimab clinical studies.5 ABOUT SJGRENS DISEASE Sjgrens disease (SjD) is one of the most prevalent autoantibody-driven diseases for which no therapies are currently approved that treat the underlying and systemic nature of the disease.1 It is a chronic autoimmune disease that is estimated to impact approximately four million people worldwide and is nine times more common in women than men.6,7 SjD is characterized by autoantibody production, chronic inflammation, and lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands. Most patients are affected by mucosal dryness (eyes, mouth, vagina), joint pain and fatigue.1 More than 50% of SjD patients have a moderate to severe form of the condition, and disease burden can be as high as that of rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. It is usually associated with impaired quality of life and functional capacity.6.8,9 ABOUT DAHLIAS DAHLIAS (NCT04968912) is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind study to evaluate the effects of nipocalimab in participants with primary Sjgrens disease. DAHLIAS is a Phase 2 dose-ranging study for adults with moderately-to-severely active primary SjD who were seropositive for anti-Ro60 and/or anti-Ro52 IgG antibodies. 163 adults aged 18-75 were randomized 1:1:1 to receive intravenous nipocalimab at 5 or 15 mg/kg or placebo every 2 weeks through Week 22 and received protocol-permitted background standard of care. Safety assessments were conducted through Week 30. The primary endpoint was change in baseline in the ClinESSDAI (Clinical European League Against Rheumatism Sjgrens Syndrome Disease Activity Index) Score at Week 24. ClinESSDAI is a systemic diseases activity index designed to measure disease activity in patients with primary SjD based on 11 domains including: constitutional, lymphadenopathy, glandular, articular, cutaneous, respiratory, renal, muscular, peripheral nervous system, central nervous system, and hematological. ABOUT NIPOCALIMAB Nipocalimab is an investigational monoclonal antibody, designed to bind with high affinity to block FcRn and reduce levels of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies potentially without impact on other immune functions. This includes autoantibodies and alloantibodies that underlie multiple conditions across three key segments in the autoantibody space including Rare Autoantibody diseases, Maternal Fetal diseases mediated by maternal alloantibodies and Rheumatic diseases.5,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.17 Blockade of IgG binding to FcRn in the placenta is also believed to limit transplacental transfer of maternal alloantibodies to the fetus.18,19 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have granted several key designations to nipocalimab including: - U.S. FDA Fast Track designation in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) in July 2019, gMG in December 2021 and fetal neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) in March 2024 and Sjgrens disease (SjD) in March 2025 - U.S. FDA Orphan drug status for wAIHA in December 2019, HDFN in June 2020, gMG in February 2021, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) in October 2021 and FNAIT in December 2023 - U.S. FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation for HDFN in February 2024 and for Sjgrens disease in November 2024 - U.S. FDA granted Priority Review in gMG in Q4 2024 - EU EMA Orphan medicinal product designation for HDFN in October 2019 ABOUT JOHNSON & JOHNSON At Johnson & Johnson, we believe health is everything.

{"doc_id":"ef3b0a22a611e9d8","title":"Inside HGG Advances: A Chat with Daffodil Canson - ASHG","content":"Posted By: HGG Advances Each month, the editors of Human Genetics and Genomics Advances interview an early-career researcher who has published work in the journal. This month we check in with Daffodil Canson () to discuss her paper Splicing annotation of endometrial cancer GWAS risk loci reveals potentially causal variants and supports a role for NF1 and SKAP1 as susceptibility genes. HGGA: What motivated you to start working on this project? DC: I have a long-standing interest in studying variant effects on gene expression and protein function and in unravelling the molecular mechanisms of disease-associated variants. As part of my PhD project, I developed the SpliceAI-10k calculator, a SpliceAI-based splicing prediction tool that facilitates identification of variants that alter splicing motifs leading to aberrant or alternative splicing. This tool performed well on the training dataset of high-risk variants in Mendelian disease genes. The next logical step was to try out the tool with other variant datasets. Candidate causal variants from the largest endometrial cancer GWAS risk meta-analysis offered a great starting point for expanding the application of the SpliceAI-10k calculator, as there was no prior splicing analysis conducted using this dataset. Integrating the splicing predictions with large-scale annotations of alternative transcript isoforms and tissue sQTLs then identified potentially causal variants that may mediate their effects on endometrial cancer risk through alternative splicing. HGGA: What about this paper/project most excites you? DC: I enjoyed the process of looking for supporting evidence for my splicing predictions, which eventually led to the creation of a splicing annotation workflow for GWAS risk variants. The most exciting part was the discovery of annotated alternative transcript isoforms and sQTL data that supported the splicing predictions. It is very rewarding to see ones tool working as intended. HGGA: What do you hope is the impact of this work for the human genetics community? DC: I hope that the splicing annotation workflow presented in our paper will also be useful in the interpretation of other GWAS datasets. The workflow can facilitate the prioritization of candidate causal variants for functional follow-up studies and aid the discovery of target genes. HGGA: What are some of the biggest challenges youve faced as a young scientist? DC: Keeping up with the latest bioinformatic tools, molecular methods, and large-scale genetic annotations is my biggest challenge; keeping my sanity in this rapidly advancing research field is a close second. As a young scientist, it is important to avoid becoming too overwhelmed with the amount of data to be handled and with the difficulty of solving research problems, especially when exploring uncharted territory. The ability to withstand frustrations and failures is essential. I am grateful to be working in a supportive and collaborative environment that helps me face these challenges. HGGA: And for fun, what is one of the most fascinating things in genetics youve learned about in the past year or so? DC: It is fascinating to see the growing role of artificial intelligence in the development of clinical variant interpretation models and the use of such models in guiding patient diagnosis and management.","url":"https://www.ashg.org/hgga/inside-hgg-advances-with-daffodil-canson/"}

{"doc_id":"0e16a46700d8b0e0","title":"How the daffodil got its trumpet | University of Oxford","content":"How the daffodil got its trumpet The daffodil is one of the few plants with a 'corona', a crown-like structure also referred to as the 'trumpet'. New research suggests that the corona is not an extension of the petals as previously thought, but is a distinct organ sharing more genetic identity with stamens, the pollen-producing reproductive organs. The origin of the corona has long been a subject of debate in botany, and in the 1930s botanist Agnes Arber claimed that it was an extension from the petals. With its colourful petal-like appearance, it's easy to see why this was believed for so long. Yet by studying the corona's development and genetic information, this new study has shown that it is in fact related to stamens. Dr Robert Scotland of the University of Oxford led the research, and was supported by colleagues at Harvard University, the United States Department of Agriculture and the University of Western Australia. The researchers were funded by the Gatsby Charitable Foundation and the United States National Science Foundation. The study is published online in The Plant Journal. By studying the development of daffodil flowers, the researchers found that the corona only begins to form after the other parts of the flower are fully established. 'This shows that the corona could not be a straightforward modification of either petals or stamens,' explains Dr Scotland. 'Since it develops independently of both, it is more accurately described as a separate organ.' The different parts of daffodil flowers are located on a small cup-like platform termed the 'hypanthium'. The researchers analysed genetic activity in all parts of the daffodil flower, and found that daffodil coronas were genetically similar to the stamens and hypanthium, but not the petals. 'We found that the corona develops from the hypanthium, and is not simply en extension of the petals or stamens,' says Dr Scotland. 'The corona is an independent organ, sharing more genetic identity with stamens, and which develops after the other organs are fully established.'.","url":"https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2013-02-19-how-daffodil-got-its-trumpet"}
{"doc_id":"64ede511c6f95893","title":"Daffodils Bloom To Aid Cancer Research — Harvard Gazette","content":"Daffodils Bloom To Aid Cancer Research While other funding sources balked, the American Cancer Society decades ago funded Andrus Professor of Pediatric Surgery Judah Folkmans research into ways to cut off the blood supply to cancerous tumors. Today, Folkmans research and the anti-angiogenesis drugs it has spawned is being hailed as a new hope in fighting cancer. And the American Cancer Society is still raising money for research, sometimes gambling on research that others might not back. The Cancer Society honored Harvard University Monday for being the largest single contributor in Massachusetts during last years Daffodil Days fundraiser, one of the societys three largest fundraisers annually. Harvards involvement with Daffodil Days started in 1988, when Rita Corkery, former associate director of community relations in the Office of Government, Community and Public Affairs and a cancer survivor, coordinated Harvards first effort, which raised $2,500. Last year, Harvard staff, students, and faculty bought nearly 6,000 bouquets of daffodils, raising $28,000 for the Cancer Society. Carole Lee, department administrator for the Office of Government, Community and Public Affairs, and the current coordinator of the Universitys Daffodil Day campaign, accepted the award for the University at a luncheon to kick off this years Daffodil Days at the Boston Harbor Hotel in Boston. Lee thanked those who help with the program, including the Departmental coordinators 99 of them who do the legwork in getting the word out to colleagues about the fundraising program. After the luncheon, Lee said the Daffodil Days program draws universal support because cancer is so common in society. Theres not one of us whos not been touched by cancer, Lee said. Helene Palmer, the Cancer Societys regional executive for development in Cambridge, said she has just begun fundraising in Cambridge, and is both encouraged and a bit daunted by Harvards enthusiasm. Im lucky, but a bit overwhelmed to be inheriting Harvard because its a magnificent effort, Palmer said. It just takes a very special breed of volunteer and people with a special heart. Lee said many people were essential to Harvards effort last year, which she said raised about $4,000 more than the previous years $24,000. Among the driving forces of Harvards Daffodil Days campaign, Lee said, are the coordinators for the Harvard entities that were the top bouquet-sellers last year, namely Maureen Leary and Kay Lawless at Harvard Law School, Peter Conlin at the University Development Office, and Donna McLean and Jennifer Moltin at the School of Public Health. Lee also thanked Ursula Moore, manager of Harvard University Mail Services, who has taken over the distribution of the flowers, much to Lees relief. Now, instead of Lee having to recruit volunteers to distribute 6,000 bunches of daffodils, University Mail Services workers deliver the flowers along with their regular mail deliveries. Each year for more than a decade, Daffodil Days coordinators have fanned out across the University and taken orders for bunches of 10 flowers. The bunches are being sold for $5 each. In addition to research, Daffodil Days funding goes to cancer detection programs, education, and patient services, such as transportation of cancer patients to treatments, one-on-one support for women with breast cancer, tobacco control education, and mammography outreach. Cancer Society officials say theyre hoping to raise $2.8 million this year in New England, up from last years $2.6 million. Daffodils are the first flower of spring, the American Cancer Society symbol of hope, hope that more lives will be saved from cancer, Don Gudaitis, CEO of the Societys New England division, said at the luncheon. You [Lee and other Daffodil Days coordinators] are making a difference when you read about progress in research, when you read about tobacco control in Massachusetts. Research into new cancer treatments has paid off over time. Five-year cancer survival rates have risen from about 41 percent in the 1980s to more than 60 percent in the 1990s. Thats clear progress over a very short period of time, Gudaitis said.","url":"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2000/02/daffodils-bloom-to-aid-cancer-research/"}

The DAFFODIL study was conducted in girls aged 2-4 years with RTT to examine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of trofinetide and to validate that the recommended dosage, according to body weight, achieved target exposure. Methods: DAFFODIL was a phase 2/3, open-label study of trofinetide consisting of two treatment periods (12 weeks [period A] and 21 months [period B]). Pharmacokinetic samples were collected at regular intervals during period A. Assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and exploratory efficacy (Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement [CGI-I], CGI-Severity, caregiver GI-I [CaGI-I], and overall quality of life rating of the Impact of Childhood Neurologic Disability Scale [ICND-QoL]). Optional caregiver exit interviews were also conducted. Findings: Fifteen participants were enrolled. Overall, the most common TEAEs were diarrhea (80.0%) and vomiting (53.3%), which were mild or moderate in severity. Steady-state exposure at clinical doses fell within the target exposure range. RTT symptoms improved throughout the study as measured by the CGI-I, CaGI-I, and change from baseline in the ICND-QoL. In caregiver interviews (n = 7), all caregivers reported they were \"very satisfied\" or \"satisfied\" with trofinetide benefits. Conclusions: Trofinetide has acceptable tolerability in girls 2-4 years of age with RTT and provides long-term efficacy. Weight-based dosage achieves target exposure in younger children. Funding: The study was supported by Acadia Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, CA). This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04988867).
