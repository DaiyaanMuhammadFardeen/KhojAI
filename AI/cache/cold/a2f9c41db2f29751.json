Reputedly, the very first successful words using his new instrument, as Bell called it, were spoken by him to his associate Thomas Watson who was out of earshot in another room: Mr Watson, come here I want to see you. Bells family background a grandfather, father and uncle all elocutionists; a mother and wife who were deaf led him to obsessively research hearing and speech. Eventually, his work with deaf people and years of experimentation into acoustics and the human voice culminated in the momentous invention that changed the world. Here we look at the sometimes controversial life of this remarkable scientist and inventor. Please note: some of Bells views on Deaf people and Deafness are controversial and considered incorrect and offensive today. Some people might find these views distressing, so please read with discretion. The early life of Alexander Graham Bell Alexander Bell was unexceptional at his Scottish school, Weston House Academy in Elgin, but became a fine self-taught pianist and had a clever inquiring mind. At 12 years old he invented a simple device to dehusk wheat, using nail brushes, that a neighbour employed in his grain mill. In 1862, he left school at 15, moving to London, partly to escape from his over-bearing father, but also to care for his grandfather who encouraged his precocious intellect and sharpened his mind through serious discussion. Bell later returned to Weston House, becoming first a teacher of elocution and music and then as assistant master. In his spare time he experimented with electricity to transmit sound. He later briefly attended the University of Edinburgh, studying anatomy and physiology. Early experiments with sound Bells mothers hearing had started to fail when she was a child. The young Bell developed a method of talking in a deep resonant way close to her ear which helped her to hear, sparking his later research into acoustics. Bells father an eminent elocutionist and author on the subject encouraged his sons interest in speech and sound. Inspired by an automated talking head that they had been to see, the teenage Bell and his brother Melville (who later opened his own elocution school) made their own. It appeared to say mama when air was blown into it as Bell worked the lips. They also created a living talking dog by teaching the family terrier to growl on command, then manipulating the pets lips so the animal seemed to say how are you grandmama? Bell began helping his father at Visible Speech demonstrations. The elder Bell had developed a method of translating sounds made by the human voice into a series of written symbols in order to teach deaf people to speak (oralism). The symbols indicated how to use and shape the tongue and mouth. Moving to Canada Bells younger brother Edward had died of tuberculosis Spring 1867. Three years later, his older brother Melville died of the same disease. Now, with Bell himself ill with tuberculosis, his bereaved parents decided to relocate the surviving family to a healthier climate, buying a farm near Brantford, Ontario. The 23 year old Bell moved to Canada very reluctantly, having had some success in London working with pupils who were then described as Deaf-Mute an archaic term, now considered offensive, that meant a person who was unable to hear or speak. Bell continued using the Visible Speech method, set up a workshop and pursued his experiments into sound. Working with deafness In 1871, Bell took up a post at the Boston School, successfully teaching the Visible Speech system, then moved on to teach the same programme at the American Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb the first school for the deaf in America and the Clarke Institution for the Deaf-Mutes. A year later he set up in private practice in Boston the School of Vocal Physiology and Mechanics of Speech attracting a large number of pupils. Bell became a US citizen in 1882. At the time, the prevailing philosophy about deafness was that to speak was to be human and that deaf people unfortunates should learn to speak in order to fully engage with society. Communication by sign language was mostly prohibited by teachers and often punished. Oralism was perceived as the right way forward. Thus Bell, while genuinely committed to helping deaf people, encouraged speech therapy and lip reading over sign language. He infamously said: We should try ourselves to forget that they are deaf. We should try to teach them to forget they are deaf. His approach is still highly controversial and divisive within the Deaf community to this day. Bells benefactors During this period of his life, Bell became exhausted and unwell trying to juggle teaching with his continuing research into sound. As a result, he largely gave up his private practice to concentrate on his experiments. Bell kept on two deaf pupils: 6 year old Georgie Sanders and 15 year old Mabel Hubbard. They both had wealthy fathers, Thomas Sanders and Gardiner Greene Hubbard, later becoming Bells patrons and friends and financially supporting his research. Bell grew gradually closer to his pupil Mabel, 10 years his junior, and she to him, eventually marrying July 1877. They had four children: two sons who died shortly after birth and two daughters, Elsie and Marian. Bell experiments with improving the telegraph From around the mid-19th century, before Bells invention of the telephone, communication over distance was by means of the electric telegraph, which allowed the wire transmission of text messages more rapidly than the sending of letters. It used an electric current to move magnetic needles to transmit a message in code, translated at the other end by a skilled operator Bell had long been investigating the harmonic telegraph trying to make this conventional telegraphy more sophisticated in order to transmit several messages simultaneously, using tuned electronic metal reeds, to send/receive multiple frequencies along a single wire, avoiding the cost of constructing new lines. This led him to conclude that there might be a way to transmit the human voice by telegraph over a wire an acoustic telegraph. The invention of the telephone Bell did not have sufficient technical knowledge to develop his idea, but a chance meeting with a clever 20 year old electrical engineer Thomas Watson (1854-1934) in a Boston, Massachusetts, electrical shop changed everything Backed by Sanders and Hubbards money (Hubbard wanted to break Western Unions monopoly of the telegraph), in 1875 the pair worked together in Boston on the acoustic telegraph and the telephone. On 14 February 1876, Bells lawyer applied for a patent at the US Patent Office for transmitting vocal or other sounds, even though as yet there was no working telephone. Securing a patent for the telephone On the exact same day that Bell filed for his patent, 14 February, another inventor working on the acoustic telegraph, Elisha Gray, filed for a similar patent. His used water to transmit sound. He also had no working telephone. But it was Bell who was finally granted the patent three weeks later. There is continuing controversy about whose application arrived first and was the most valid, as well as whether Bell misappropriated Grays idea of using liquid as a transmitter three days after being awarded the patent, Bell succeeded in getting his telephone to work. The very first words using his new instrument, as Bell called it, transcribed in his lab notes, were spoken by him to Thomas Watson who was out of earshot in another room: Mr Watson, come here I want to see you. Over the following nearly 20 years, the Bell Telephone Company founded July 1877 (later AT&T), successfully fought off 587 challenges to Bells patent. Bells development of the telephone The American Philadelphia Centennial was an enormous 19th-century world fair showcasing new inventions including typewriters, sewing machines and Heinz ketchup. It opened in May 1876. Here, in public, Bell successfully demonstrated his prototype telephone, proving that it worked. Back in Boston, reunited with Watson, the pair continued experimenting, gradually extending the distance over which the telephone would work. A continuing series of countrywide lectures and demonstrations followed. Interest in the telephone grew rapidly, both with the public and in the wider scientific community. Within three months of Bell, Hubbard, Sanders and Watson founding the Bell Telephone Company, July 1877, to commercialise the telephone, around 1,300 devices were in operation in America. By New Year 1880, there were 30,000. However, Bells interest in the telephone waned in the early 1880s. He was already wealthy. He sold off most of his holdings in the Bell Telephone Company and, by the mid-1880s, his role in the telephone industry was peripheral. In 1888, Bell became a founding member of the National Geographic Society, and was its president three years later. His restlessly inventive mind wanted to keep pushing forwards the boundaries of scientific knowledge: Some of Alexander Bells other inventions In 1888, Bell became a founding member of the National Geographic Society, and was its president three years later. His restlessly inventive mind needed more challenges: He created, among other inventions, a metal detector that was later used to locate bullets and shrapnel in wounded soldiers during the Boer War (1899 to 1902) and the First World War (1914 to 1918), as well as the AEA Silver Dart bi-plane, and designs for winged hydrofoil boats that could zip across water at high speed. He also designed the aileron a key part of aircraft manoeuvrability, helping it bank left or right. The telephone comes to Britain Bells fame spread round the world, to such an extent that he was invited to demonstrate his telephone to Queen Victoria at Osborne House, Isle of Wight, 14 January 1878.",
