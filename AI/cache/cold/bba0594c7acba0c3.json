IEEE Press Books Attribute-based Encryption (ABE): Foundations and Applications within Blockchain and Cloud Environments Principles and Applications of Blockchain Systems: How to Overcome the CAP Trilemma in Consortium Blockchain IEEE Special Issues In our latest IEEE Talks Blockchain Q&A session, we spoke with Dr. Ramesh Ramadoss, co-chair of the IEEE Blockchain Initiative. Ramadoss discusses the evolution of the blockchain ecosystem, including emerging applications, standardization efforts, and opportunities for future growth and development. IEEE White Papers IEEE Blockchain Transactive Energy (BCTE) Position Paper A Bridge to a Democratized Energy Marketplace IEEE Blockchain - May 2021 This Position Paper describes the basic framework and principles for using blockchain technology in power and energy domains with the emerging participatory grid. A key goal is the development of the most promising global Transactive Energy use cases which can be advanced toward broader commercialization using blockchain technology. Reinforcing the Links of the Blockchain IEEE Future Directions - November 2017 The purpose of this white paper is to explore the various ways by which the IEEE can lead and support an initiative on Blockchain while providing educational materials that will foster the next generation of blockchain engineers. This white paper summarizes and expands upon the IEEE Blockchain Incubator Workshop held by IEEE Future Directions at the end of October in 2017.

In this article additional insights into how blockchain can add value to a business process relationship is detailed. Specically an engineering contract workow use application pilot including various high level system architectural aspects are presented. This application shows the integration of blockchain technology with existing legacy systems. Some management and technology issues are also overviewed for the reader. Blockchain-Enabled E-Voting IEEE Software - July/August 2018 By Nir Kshetri and Jeffrey Voas Published in the July/August 2018 issue of IEEE Software; recognized among the top eight winners of the 2018 Most Influential Blockchain Research Papers by the Third Blockchain Connect Conference Awards. \"E-Voting is among the key public sectors that can be disrupted by blockchain technology. The idea in blockchain-enabled e-voting (BEV) is simple. To use a digital-currency analogy, BEV issues each voter a wallet containing a user credential. Each voter gets a single coin representing one opportunity to vote. Casting a vote transfers the voters coin to a candidates wallet. A voter can spend his or her coin only once. However, voters can change their vote before a preset deadline.\" Download the paper (PDF, 463 KB) Blockchain- Privacy by Design: How Decentralized Blockchain Internet Will Comply with Data Privacy July 2018 By Claudio Lima, Ph.D., Blockchain Engineering Council, BEC Co-Founder; Vice Chair, IEEE Blockchain Standards \"The General Data Protection Regulation () that was recently approved for implementation in the EEUU by May 25th, 2018 is already creating some controversies, when confronted with emerging Blockchain technologies, regarding what they have most in common: data privacy and protection. These are two are essential areas where Blockchain shines.\" Download the paper (PDF, 899 KB) Read Dr. Lima's article \"Adapting Blockchain for Compliance\" at InformationWeek External Publications Enhanced Distributed Ledger Technology NIST Computer Security Resource Center - September 2019 The blockchain data structure and proof-of-work protocol were designed to solve the problem of double spending in cryptocurrencies. Although blockchain has found many applications outside of cryptocurrency, many of its features are not well suited to common data management applications. The added trust of distributed ledgers is a valuable feature, providing greatly simplified auditability and verification of actions among multiple parties in applications such as supply chain and others, but there are tradeoffs. Blockchain's hash-based integrity verification provides trust, at the cost of an inability to delete or update records, leading to design complications that would not arise with conventional database management systems. Similarly, the sequencing guarantees of blockchain consensus protocols are needed for cryptocurrency in the absence of a universal timestamp. Moreover, actions within the distributed ledger must be connected with other actions in the real world, through accurate timestamps. We are developing a new architecture that provides the trust features of blockchains, with characteristics that allow for simpler designs and greater practicality in conventional data management problems. We believe this alternative can lead to new approaches to incorporating trust into distributed systems applications. Blockchain and Economic Development: Hype vs. Reality Center for Global Development - July 2017 Increasing attention is being paid to the potential of blockchain technology to address long-standing challenges related to economic development. Blockchain proponents argue that it will expand opportunities for exchange and collaboration by reducing reliance on intermediaries and the frictions associated with them. The purpose of this paper is to provide a clear-eyed view of the technologys potential in the context of development. In it, we focus on identifying the questions that development practitioners should be asking technologists, and challenges that innovators must address for the technology to meet its potential. at the Center for Global Development A Case Study for Blockchain in Healthcare: MedRec prototype for electronic health records and medical research data MIT Media Lab, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center - August 2016 A decentralized record management system to handle electronic health records, using Blockchain technology that manages authentication, confidentiality, accountability and data sharing.
