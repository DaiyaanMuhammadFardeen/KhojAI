APEC SummitNVIDIA today announced plans with Samsung Electronics to build a new AI factory, representing a new era where intelligent computing and chip manufacturing converge. The state-of-the-art AI factory will combine Samsungs semiconductor technologies with NVIDIA platforms to establish the foundation of next-generation, AI-driven production. Powered by more than 50,000 NVIDIA GPUs, Samsungs semiconductor AI factory will be a centerpiece of the companys digital transformation, integrating accelerated computing directly into full-fledged advanced chip manufacturing. Through this collaboration, Samsung and NVIDIA are setting a global benchmark for AI-driven semiconductor manufacturing at scale, integrating data from physical equipment and production workflows to achieve predictive maintenance, process improvements and increased operational efficiency in autonomous fab environments. We are at the dawn of the AI industrial revolution a new era that will redefine how the world designs, builds and manufactures, said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. As Koreas and one of the worlds foremost technology and industrial leaders, Samsung is forging its AI foundation with NVIDIA to lead the future of intelligent and autonomous manufacturing transforming Samsung itself and the many industries around the world built on Samsung technologies. NVIDIA has been a visionary of this new AI era, and its technologies have empowered innovators to reinvent industries, said Jay Y. Lee, executive chairman of Samsung Electronics. From Samsungs DRAM for NVIDIAs game-changing graphics card in 1995 to our new AI factory, we are thrilled to continue our longstanding journey with NVIDIA in leading this transformation as we envision creating new standards for the future and accelerating breakthroughs for the world. From their first collaboration on NVIDIAs first graphics card NV1 with Samsungs DRAM to introducing the industrys first commercial HBM, and a key supply collaboration for HBM3E and HBM4 today, the companies celebrate a strong alliance spanning more than 25 years that has helped create the foundation for todays AI transformation. The companies will continue their semiconductor collaboration beyond HBM, GDDR, high-density memory modules, SOCAMM and custom solutions as well as foundry services to support the broader ecosystem. Samsung is harnessing NVIDIA GPUs, NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries and solutions from Synopsys, Cadence and Siemens to achieve massive speedups in circuit simulation, verification and manufacturing analysis. The companies are collaborating with these electronic design automation partners to innovate chip design, and will continue to reshape GPU-accelerated EDA tools and design technologies necessary for the AI era. Samsung uses the NVIDIA Omniverse platform as the foundation for its digital twins, which provide physically accurate simulation environments. This virtual environment allows global fabs to shorten the time from design to operations and achieve AI-driven predictive maintenance, real-time decision-making and factory automation. To speed intelligent logistics with a unified platform, Samsung is deploying NVIDIA RTX PRO Servers with NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs. The real-time digital twin of the Samsung fab will enable operational planning, anomaly detection and logistics optimization a significant step toward a fully autonomous fab. To accelerate computational lithography the most computationally intensive workload in the semiconductor manufacturing process the companies are integrating the NVIDIA cuLitho library into Samsungs advanced lithography platform, OPC. The collaboration has led to 20x greater performance and scalable deployment across semiconductor manufacturing. Samsung Accelerates Smart Manufacturing With Digital Twins, Robotics and Generative AI Samsung has been building its proprietary AI models powering more than 400 million Samsung devices with access to advanced reasoning capabilities, delivering breakthrough performance in real-time translation, multilingual interactions and intelligent summarization. Samsung is charting the future of intelligent robotics across manufacturing automation and humanoid robot applications using NVIDIA robotics technologies on NVIDIA RTX PRO Servers. To accelerate intelligent robot deployment, Samsung is using the NVIDIA Isaac Sim reference application, built on NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models, to connect synthetic and real data, middleware and teleoperation, as well as the NVIDIA Jetson Thor high-performance edge AI platform optimized for humanoid robotics. Combined, these technologies enable the deployment of robots that can understand and interact with the physical world in real time. NVIDIA and Samsung also worked with Korean telco operators and academic institutions to develop AI-RAN network technology, bringing together AI and mobile network workloads, which will be necessary for the adoption of physical AI.",
