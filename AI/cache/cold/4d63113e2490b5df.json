  "content": "Summary Following a massive protest movement in Bangladesh that toppled the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, politicians, civil society, students, diplomats, United Nations rights experts, and others quickly started work with an interim government to bring lasting reforms. Led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, the interim government took office on August 8, 2024, pledging to undo the damage to human rights and democracy during the Hasina administrations 15 years in office. As Chief Advisor Yunus told Prothom Alo: We don't want flimsy reforms. We don't want eye-wash reforms. We want fundamental reforms. We will bring about these reforms in such a manner that they cannot be changed by anyone. After winning the 2009 election, Sheikh Hasinas Awami League party-led government had gradually consolidated power by silencing critics, harassing activists, and arbitrarily arresting, forcibly disappearing, and killing members of the opposition or civil society who spoke out against her. In January 2024, Sheikh Hasina won a fourth consecutive term in office after her administration again refused to hold credible elections, marking a decade since Bangladeshis had been able to exercise their right to choose their leaders. During her reign, the Hasina-led government effectively captured key institutions that otherwise could offer independent oversight and justice including the election commission, the human rights commission, the police, and the judiciary, ensuring that they instead served to keep the Awami League in office. On August 5, 2024, Hasina was finally forced to leave office after three weeks of student-led street protests, described by some Bangladeshis as the Monsoon Revolution. The interim government has committed to holding free and fair elections after repairing the security sector, the justice system, and other core institutions. The interim government has also said that it will bring legislative changes through presidential order, which will later be ratified by an elected parliament. While embarking upon these critical steps, the interim government is also contending with powerful and politicized security forces that have long benefited from a system of impunity. Due to the deeply ingrained systemic obstacles to accountable governance, a disturbingly familiar pattern of security force abuses and political reprisals has reemerged, this time targeting perceived Awami League supporters. Groups promoting extremist Islam are attacking minorities, particularly those from Hindu and Ahmadiyya communities. Ethnic minorities in the Chittagong Hill Tracts endure continued discrimination and violence by the authorities. While the interim government has introduced a new ordinance to replace an abusive law used to crush freedom of speech under the Awami League, the new legislation unfortunately replicates many of the same harmful provisions. Student leaders and activists are expressing concern that the interim government is being hemmed in by various political interests at home and abroad. Many are worried that the pace of reforms has slowed down. As one student leader said: In Bangladeshs history, repeatedly, whoever has been in power, people have had to shed blood to restore democracy. We would like lasting reforms, strong institutions, and empowered people, so that there is never again scope for authoritarianism. No Bangladeshi should have to sacrifice their life again to win democracy. Bangladeshis have called for rights respecting governance. This effort, led by a fragile interim government that seeks to remain politically neutral, must be robustly supported by donors, international experts, and civil society. Most significantly, the criminal justice system should uphold international standards on the presumption of innocence and the right to due process as perpetrators of serious human rights violations are identified through investigations. To ensure effective reforms, the government has sought input from stakeholders. This report draws on over 20 years of Human Rights Watch reporting on abuses in Bangladesh both under the Hasina administration and by those before her, as well as interviews with human rights activists, members of the interim government, and current and former law enforcement and military officialsto set out the structural reforms needed for lasting change. The Monsoon Revolution Violence first erupted on July 15, 2024, when the ruling Awami League party supporters and police attacked students peacefully protesting discriminatory and politicized quotas in government jobs. Students across the country launched protests in response. The Hasina government deployed security forces who used tear gas, stun grenades, and rubber and live bullets, shooting indiscriminately into crowds and directly at students. As one police officer told Human Rights Watch, I witnessed officers firing at vital organs. In many cases, I witnessed live ammunition being fired even when officers lives were not in danger. Another described witnessing senior officers in the Dhaka Metropolitan Police Headquarters watch live CCTV footage and direct officers on the ground to shoot protesters like they were ordering someone to shoot in a video game. A July 16 video spread rapidly on social media showing university student Abu Sayed standing, his arms outstretched, as police repeatedly shot at him. After his death, and the deaths of others, outraged students across the country came out in the streets and were later joined by ordinary citizens and opposition supporters. The protests soon expanded to represent opposition to Hasinas autocratic rule, characterized by security force abuses, widespread repression, and corruption, with slogans calling for her resignation. As protests spread, the authorities instituted a strict curfew enforced with a shoot-on-sight order, imposed a nationwide internet shutdown, and arrested thousands of people. One student, Mohammad Rahat Husain, described to Human Rights Watch being shot at by police when he and his friends were sitting at a teashop during the curfew. Despite hiding inside the shop, police charged inside and told the students to run. But when one of his friends, Tayem, started to run, police shot him from behind. I tried to drag him away, but the police kept firing, and a rubber bullet hit my leg. Tayem was dying, with his wrists limp and his eyes staring blankly. The last words he said to me were: Bhai, leave me. I started running, but they fired at me again. This time, I wasnt hit. I was screaming for someone to help Tayem. Despite the grave risks, thousands continued to protest. On August 4, protesters marched towards the prime ministers residence demanding that she resign. Hasina responded by reportedly calling on officials to curb anarchists with iron hands. But as the streets filled with protesters threatening to overrun government buildings, on August 5, Sheikh Hasina fled the country. Now exiled in India, she has claimed that she left to prevent further bloodshed and has denied any wrongdoing. The Yunus administration, alongside Students Against Discrimination, the group that had led the protests, continue to update the list of those killed. As of December 2024, they confirmed at least 858 deaths. Another nearly 250 people, including policemen, were killed in retributive violence after Hasinas resignation. Interim Government Within weeks of taking power, the Yunus administration released thousands of people who had been detained during the protests and made commitments to pursue accountability for torture, extrajudicial killings, and enforced disappearances, and ensure human rights protections. It has said it will drop police investigations and charges against peaceful critics of Sheikh Hasina, her relatives and associates, and her administration. At least 30 police officials were arrested for their alleged involvement in using unlawful force against protesters during the Monsoon Revolution. The interim government also invited the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to investigate abuses by government forces during the protests and their root causes. A commission of inquiry into all enforced disappearances, established on August 27, has made significant progress in identifying secret detention sites and has named some perpetrators, a monumental step after years of denials by the previous government. The interim government has also acceded to the UN Convention on Enforced Disappearances and has invited assistance from the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. On September 12, the interim government formed six commissions to recommend reforms to the judiciary, the electoral system, public administration, police, the anti-corruption office, and the constitution. It later established four additional commissions to make policy recommendations on media, health, labor rights, and womens rights. Students who led the protests have a voice in these commissions. As of writing, the six main commissions are expected to submit their recommendations by January 15 (January 31 for the judicial reform commission). Then another commission will be formed, comprising the heads of the six commissions, which will be chaired by the chief advisor, Yunus, to forge a consensus around reforms and then to initiate implementation. Despite these important steps, police have returned to the abusive practices that characterized the previous government, this time targeting supportersor perceived supportersof the Awami League government. For instance, in the first two months since the interim government took office, over 1,000 police cases were filed against tens of thousands of people, mainly Awami League members, accusing them of murder, corruption, or other crimes. Over 400 Awami League ministers and leaders are facing investigations. In some of these cases, complainants were not even aware of who was being named as accused.",
