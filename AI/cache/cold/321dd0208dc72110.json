  "content": "Assassins Creed Shadows is looking magnificent. Im looking at my 2024/2025 Bingo card, and I didnt have Ubisoft Redemption Tour on it. But, judging by whats been revealed in an exclusive chat with Entertainment Weekly? Shadows might have the sauce, man. I cant even offer my usual snarky comments about it. So, Entertainment Weekly sat down with the creative director of Assassins Creed Shadows, Jonathan Dumont. The main topic of discussion was one of the games co-leads, Naoe. Specifically, we were given a sneak peek of what to expect from the stealth shinobis backstory! Videos by VICE Assassins Creed Shadows plays out through the dueling perspectives of both Yasuke and Naoe. Their stories start to collide in 1579, the year that the son of feudal lord Oda Nobunaga, the daimy Yasuke serves, tries and fails to invade Iga. [Naoe] was shielded by her father from whats happening in the world, and it comes crashing down, Dumont explains. fine, ubisoft I guess assassins creed shadows will be one of 2025s best games She is pushed into war. She doesnt know much about her origins. Her fathers been training her, but she doesnt know much about her mother, whos been gone. But as a cool proverb from Japan says, a frog in a well knows nothing of the sea. She is tossed into the real world, and through that, she will learn that she is not just a shinobi, that there is a little bit of a lineage or at least some mystery about some sort of different type of shinobi. Theyre Assassins, so shes somewhat linked to that, Dumont tells EW. As a lover of Batman, I gotta say, Naoe is certainly radiating Protector of Gotham. I thought Yasuke would be my favored choice in Assassins Creed Shadows. But, perhaps Naoe has sprung up to the top of the mountain! Dumont left us with a final teaser, refusing to reveal all his secrets! She will start a bit of a path of vengeance or fulfilling a promise that she made to her family, he says. As she discovers a world in need, she begins to really value the community values her father taught. Can she make a better world? [She realizes] they are people who cannot defend themselves, which is tied a little bit more to the models of the [Assassin] Brotherhood.",
