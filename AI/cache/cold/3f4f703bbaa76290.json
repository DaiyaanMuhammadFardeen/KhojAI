  "content": "What happens next after Sheikh Hasina's guilty verdictpublished at GMT 17 November Mir Sabbir Editor, BBC News Bangla Sheikh Hasina has now been convicted by the court that she established in 2010 to try war crimes committed during Bangladeshs 1971 liberation war. But one significant question has emerged - will it have any effect on the former ruling Awami League party, which Hasina still heads - and what does it mean for her future in politics, if any? The Bangladesh government has for months been calling for Hasina, who currently resides in India, to be extradited. A previous extradition plea was for a lesser sentence for contempt of court, which India did not respond to. But if an elected government comes to power following the scheduled Bangladesh national elections in February next year and pushes for her extradition, or puts pressure to stop her from carrying on party activities from there, it could make it more difficult for India to ignore such a request from an elected government. Even before the verdict, a court had imposed a ban on media outlets publishing what it termed her 'provocative statements' - a move condemned by her party, the Awami League. The interim government has also banned the party's activities by executive order. Since the ouster of its government, the Awami League has been largely invisible from politics on the ground. All its top leaders are in exile, many of them in India, while others have been arrested. Any further restrictions on Hasinas statements or the Awami Leagues operations following this verdict would place the party under considerable pressure. While the party maintains there is no internal debate over her leadership, it remains to be seen whether mounting legal restrictions, coupled with increased diplomatic pressure on India for her return, will compel the Awami League to adopt a different strategy in the days ahead.
