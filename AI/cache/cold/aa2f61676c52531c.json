Featured Verifiable quantum advantage towards real world applications Marking a key step toward real-world applications, we've published a new breakthrough algorithm on our Willow quantum processor, Quantum Echoes, which demonstrates the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage. Introducing Willow, the next generation of quantum chips Willow, Google Quantum AI's latest state-of-the-art quantum chip, is a big step towards developing a large-scale, error-corrected quantum computer. Read the blog and watch the video to about Willow and its breakthrough achievements.
