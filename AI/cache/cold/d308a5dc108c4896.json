  "content": "General Information The information on these pages should be used to research health risks and to inform the pre-travel consultation. Travellers should check the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) country-specific travel advice page (where available) which provides information on travel entry requirements in addition to safety and security advice. Travellers should ideally arrange an appointment with their health professional at least four to six weeks before travel. However, even if time is short, an appointment is still worthwhile. This appointment provides an opportunity to assess health risks taking into account a number of factors including destination, medical history, and planned activities. For those with pre-existing health problems, an earlier appointment is recommended. All travellers should ensure they have adequate travel health insurance. A list of useful resources including advice on how to reduce the risk of certain health problems is available below Resources Vaccine Recommendations Details of vaccination recommendations and requirements are provided below. All travellers Travellers should be up to date with routine vaccination courses and boosters as recommended in the UK. These vaccinations include for example measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and diphtheria-tetanus-polio vaccine. Country-specific diphtheria recommendations are not provided here. Diphtheria tetanus and polio are combined in a single vaccine in the UK. Therefore, when a tetanus booster is recommended for travellers, diphtheria vaccine is also given. Should there be an outbreak of diphtheria in a country, diphtheria vaccination guidance will be provided. Those who may be at increased risk of an infectious disease due to their work, lifestyle choice, or certain underlying health problems should be up to date with additional recommended vaccines. See details on the selective immunisation programmes and additional vaccines for individuals with underlying medical conditions at the bottom of the 'Complete routine immunisation schedule' document and the individual chapters of the 'Green Book' Immunisation against infectious disease for further details. Certificate requirements Please read the information below carefully, as certificate requirements may be relevant to certain travellers only. For travellers further details, if required, should be sought from their healthcare professional. - There is no risk of yellow fever in Bangladesh, however, there is a certificate requirement. - Under International Health Regulations, proof of vaccination against yellow fever is required from travellers aged 1 year or over arriving from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission and for travellers having transited through an airport of a country with risk of yellow fever transmission. - According to World Health Organization (WHO), from 11 July 2016 (for all countries), the yellow fever certificate will be valid for the duration of the life of the person vaccinated. As a consequence, a valid certificate, presented by arriving travellers, cannot be rejected on the grounds that more than ten years have passed since the date vaccination became effective as stated on the certificate; and that boosters or revaccination cannot be required. - View the WHO list of countries with risk of yellow fever transmission. - There is no risk of polio in this country. However, proof of polio vaccination may be necessary for some travellers. Please check the World Health Organization: International Travel and Health for latest country specific information. Most travellers The vaccines in this section are recommended for most travellers visiting this country. Information on these vaccines can be found by clicking on the blue arrow. Vaccines are listed alphabetically. Hepatitis A Hepatitis A is a viral infection transmitted through contaminated food and water or by direct contact with an infectious person. Symptoms are often mild or absent in young children, but the disease can be more serious with advancing age. Recovery can vary from weeks to months. Following hepatitis A infection immunity is lifelong. Prevention All travellers should take care with personal, food and water hygiene. Hepatitis A vaccination As hepatitis A vaccine is well tolerated and affords long-lasting protection, it is recommended for all previously unvaccinated travellers. Hepatitis A in brief Tetanus Tetanus is caused by a toxin released from Clostridium tetani bacteria and occurs worldwide. Tetanus bacteria are present in soil and manure and may be introduced through open wounds such as a puncture wound, burn or scratch. Prevention Travellers should thoroughly clean all wounds and seek medical attention for injuries such as animal bites/scratches, burns or wounds contaminated with soil. Tetanus vaccination - Travellers should have completed a tetanus vaccination course according to the UK schedule. - If travelling to a country or area where medical facilities may be limited, a booster dose of a tetanus-containing vaccine is recommended if the last dose was more than ten years ago even if five doses of vaccine have been given previously. Country-specific information on medical facilities may be found in the 'health' section of the FCDO foreign travel advice pages. Tetanus in brief Typhoid Typhoid is a bacterial infection transmitted through contaminated food and water. Previous typhoid illness may only partially protect against re-infection. Vaccination is recommended for most travellers, particularly travellers visiting friends and relatives, those in contact with an infected person, young children, frequent or long-stay travellers visiting areas where sanitation and food hygiene are likely to be poor, and laboratory personnel who may handle the bacteria for their work. Typhoid vaccination - Oral and injectable typhoid vaccinations are available. Typhoid in brief Some travellers The vaccines in this section are recommended for some travellers visiting this country. Information on when these vaccines should be considered can be found by clicking on the arrow. Chikungunya Chikungunya is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes which bite mainly during daytime hours. It causes a flu-like illness and can cause severe joint and muscles pains which usually improve in 12 weeks but may persist for months or years. Chikungunya in Bangladesh There is a risk of chikungunya in this country. Information on current outbreaks, where available, will be reported on our outbreak surveillance database. Prevention - Travellers should avoid mosquito bites, particularly during daytime hours. Chikungunya vaccination Vaccination may be considered for individuals aged 12 years of age and over who are: - travelling to regions with a current chikungunya outbreak - long-term or frequent travellers to regions with an increased risk of chikungunya - exposed to the chikungunya virus through their work, such as laboratory staff working with the virus Detailed advice about the use and contraindications of the available vaccines will be available in the green book chikungunya chapter in the coming months. For now, please see the JCVI news item and chikungunya in brief for details. Chikungunya in brief Cholera Cholera is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food and water. Cholera can cause severe watery diarrhoea, although mild infections are common. The risk of cholera for most travellers is low. Cholera vaccination This oral vaccine is recommended for those whose activities or medical history put them at increased risk of infection or complications. This includes: - humanitarian aid workers - persons going to areas of cholera outbreaks who have limited access to safe water and medical care - other travellers to cholera risk areas, for whom vaccination is considered potentially beneficial (e.g. due to their occupation, activities or underlying health problems) Cholera in brief Dengue Dengue is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes which mainly feed during daytime hours. It causes a flu-like illness, which can occasionally develop into a more serious life-threatening illness. Severe dengue is rare in travellers. The mosquitoes that spread dengue are more common in towns, cities and surrounding areas. Dengue in Bangladesh There is a risk of dengue in this country. Dengue vaccination Vaccination can be considered for individuals aged 4 years of age and older who have had dengue infection in the past and who are: - travelling to areas where there is a risk of dengue infection or areas with an ongoing outbreak of dengue, or - are exposed to dengue virus through their work, such as laboratory staff working with the virus Exceptionally, vaccination can be considered in those who have not had dengue in the past. In these situations, further expert advice should be considered. Detailed guidance on how to ascertain previous infection is available in the UK Health Security Agency Immunisation against infectious disease the 'Green book'. The final decision on vaccination rests with the health professional and the traveller after a detailed risk assessment has been performed and the potential risks of vaccination explained. Dengue in brief Hepatitis B Hepatitis B is a viral infection spread through blood, semen and vaginal fluids. This mostly occurs during sexual contact or as a result of blood-to-blood contact (for example from contaminated equipment during medical and dental procedures, tattooing or body piercing procedures, and sharing of intravenous needles). Mothers with the virus can also pass on the infection to their baby during childbirth. Hepatitis B in Bangladesh This country is considered to have an intermediate or high prevalence of hepatitis B. Prevention Travellers should avoid contact with blood or body fluids. This includes: - Avoiding unprotected sexual intercourse. - Avoiding tattooing, piercing, public shaving, and acupuncture (unless sterile equipment is used).",
