  "content": "Dear client, As notified in our prior communications in late 2020, and as a consequence of the UKs withdrawal from the European Union, Macquarie Capital (Europe) Limited (MCEL) has ceased providing brokerage services to You. We wish to notify You, that with effect from 1 August 2022 or such later day as notified to you by Macquarie, Macquarie will be launching its client facing Equities brokerage services for you in Macquarie Capital France Socit Anonyme (MCF) allowing for the resumption of our brokerage services. Historically, You have contracted with, and received contract notes/confirmations from MCEL for equity brokerage trades executed in all markets apart from India, Taiwan and Korea (the ID Markets). From the effective date, your contracting entity and legal counterparty for all non-ID Markets will, subject to your agreement, become MCF, which will act as your Receipt and Transmission of Orders (RTO) agent. Note that your confirmations and contract notes will also be issued by MCF. MCF will effectively intermediate your orders and transmit them to the applicable affiliate for execution. The European based Sales and Sales Traders that You interact with will be employed and licensed to MCF. Please refer to the information on this link for the new terms of business that will apply as between You and MCF (the MCF Terms). You will need to actively accept the MCF Terms to resume our brokerage services. Should you wish to avail yourself of direct market access and/or China Connect Securities services, You may also agree to enter into the relevant MCF Direct Market Access Agreement and the additional terms for trading China Connect Securities (collectively, Ancillary Documents) in the link provided. We CANNOT act as your broker until You have positively confirmed your acceptance of the MCF Terms. Accordingly, we would be grateful if You could confirm your acknowledgement and agreement by clicking the button below. Where you acknowledge and agree to the MCF Terms and any relevant Ancillary Documents prior to 1 August 2022, they will only take effect and apply from 1 August 2022 or such later day as notified to You by Macquarie. If You have any questions on the MCF Terms, other changes or the handling of your data, please contact us by return email as soon as possible and in any event within 30 days of receiving this communication. In addition to the changes referred to above and as part of the transition from MCEL to MCF, we may request for documentation to update our Know Your Client records for You. For the time being the settlement instructions will remain unchanged. Any changes to settlement instructions will be communicated to your settlement team. If you have not set up MCF as a broker, please contact your Macquarie account manager, who will be happy to assist You. Regards, Macquarie Capital, Equities Division.",
