  "content": "World Quantum Day 2024: The latest developments in quantum science and technology April 14 is World Quantum Day, an annual event to celebrate how we use the science of atoms and particlesthe building blocks of the universeto advance science and technology. Scientists and engineers already leverage the strange and interesting properties of quantum mechanics to advance our technology. Our understanding of quantum mechanics helps us design the semiconductors used in cars, phones, and other technology. GPS systems rely on the quantum mechanics of ultra-precise atomic clocks. Many more advancements in quantum technology are yet to come. Secure communication through metropolitan-scale entangled quantum networks, quantum machine clusters for high-end computation, and quantum sensors that enhance intracellular sensing and mapping are just some of the predicted developments. about the some of the latest quantum research and announcements coming from the UChicago Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering and its partners below. Advancements in research Scientists use novel technique to create new energy-efficient microelectronic device Researchers at UChicago Pritzker Molecular Engineering and Argonne National Laboratory have achieved a breakthrough that could allow for a new kind of microelectronic material to consume only a fraction of the electricity of conventional electronics while still operating at peak performance. In a new study published in Advanced Materials, the Argonne team proposed a new kind of redox gating technique that can control the movement of electrons in and out of a semiconducting material. Researchers from startups, government labs, and academia develop new techniques for making qubits out of erbium Two research groupsone at quantum startup memQ, founded by UChicago Pritzker Molecular Engineering alumnus Manish Singh, and one at the U.S. Department of Energys Argonne National Laboratoryhave used different host materials for erbium to advance quantum technology, demonstrating the versatility of this kind of quantum bit (qubit) and highlighting the importance of materials science to quantum computing and quantum communication. New research unites quantum engineering and artificial intelligence Researchers at UChicago Pritzker Molecular Engineering, including Chicago Quantum Exchange IBM postdoctoral scholar Junyu Liu, and collaborators show in a new paper how incorporating quantum computing into the classical machine learning process can potentially help make machine learning more sustainable and efficient. In novel quantum computer design, qubits use magnets to selectively communicate An international team of researchers have begun to use magnets to entangle qubits, the building blocks of quantum computers; the simple technique could unlock complex capabilities. Advanced computational tool for understanding quantum materials Researchers have developed a new computational tool to describe how the atoms within quantum materials behave when they absorb and emit light. The tool will be released as part of the open-source software package WEST, developed within the Midwest Integrated Center for Computational Materials (MICCoM). Researchers invent new way to stretch diamond for better quantum bits A team of UChicago Pritzker Molecular Engineering researchers announced a breakthrough in quantum network engineering: By stretching thin films of diamond, they created quantum bits that can operate with significantly reduced equipment and expense. The change also makes the bits easier to control. Major milestone achieved in new quantum computing architecture A team led by the U.S. Department of Energys (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory has achieved a major milestone toward future quantum computing. They have extended the coherence time for their novel type of qubit to an impressive 0.1 millisecondsnearly a thousand times better than the previous record. Researchers split phononsor soundin step toward new type of quantum computer In two experimentsthe first of their kindsa team led by Prof. Andrew Cleland used a device called an acoustic beamsplitter to split phonons and thereby demonstrate their quantum properties. By showing that the beamsplitter can be used to both induce a special quantum superposition state for one phonon, and further create interference between two phonons, the research team took the first critical steps toward creating a new kind of quantum computer. Noise-cancelling qubits developed at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering to minimize errors in quantum computers In a paper in Science, researchers in the lab of Asst. Hannes Bernien describe a method to constantly monitor the noise around a quantum system and adjust the qubits, in real-time, to minimize error. Simulations reveal the atomic-scale story of qubits By using sophisticated computer simulations at the atomic scale, a new study predicts the formation process of spin defects useful for quantum technologies. Chicago region designated U.S. Tech Hub for quantum technologies by Biden-Harris administration The Chicago region has been named an official U.S. Regional and Innovation Technology Hub for quantum technologies by the Biden-Harris administration, a designation that opens the door to new federal funding and recognizes the growing strength of an ecosystem poised to become the heart of the nations quantum economy. The Bloch Tech Hub (pronounced block), a coalition of industry, academic, government, and nonprofit stakeholders led by the Chicago Quantum Exchange, was one of 31 designees from nearly 400 applications across the country. Pritzker celebrates quantum technology leadership with The Bloch Tech Hub Governor JB Pritzker and Innovate Illinois announced a multi-year plan for The Bloch Tech Hub to develop quantum technology solutions for pressing issues such as fraud detection, grid resilience, and drug discovery by accelerating industry adoption to drive research commercializationan initiative that is projected to generate $60 billion in economic impact for the Chicago metro area over the next decade. University of Chicago joins global partnerships to advance quantum computing The University of Chicago formalized groundbreaking agreements with industry and university partners to transform the future of quantum technology. The first is a 10-year, $100 million plan with IBM, the University of Chicago and the University of Tokyo to develop the blueprints for building a quantum-centric supercomputer powered by 100,000 qubits. The second is a strategic partnership between the University of Chicago, the University of Tokyo and Google, with Google investing up to $50 million over 10 years, to accelerate the development of a fault-tolerant quantum computer and to help train the quantum workforce of the future. Illinois governor proposes $500M for quantum technologies in new budget Illinois Governor JB Pritzker is asking state legislators for half a billion dollars for quantum technologies in a proposed budgetthe latest show of support for a regional quantum ecosystem that has attracted millions of dollars in corporate and government investment in recent years and is emerging as a central driver of US leadership in the field.",
