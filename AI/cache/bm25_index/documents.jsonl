Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Its used everywhere from web apps and automation tools to data science and artificial intelligence. Whether youre streaming a show, booking a flight, or chatting with an AI, Python is likely working behind the scenes. Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released on February 20, 1991. While the word \"python\" might bring to mind a large snake, the languages name actually comes from the classic BBC comedy series Monty Pythons Flying Circus. What makes Python unique is that it began as the vision and work of a single person. Unlike most languages born in big tech companies, Python was created by Guido driven by a simple goal: to make programming more intuitive and enjoyable. From that idea, a global community has grown. Thousands of developers, educators, scientists, and enthusiasts continue to shape Python, expanding its reach into AI, data science, education, and beyond. Today, Python is maintained and advanced by the Python Software Foundation (PSF), a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the language, its ecosystem, and the global community that keeps it thriving. Python is everywhere from websites and mobile apps to AI assistants, satellites, and even medical devices. Its one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, with billions of lines of code written, shared, and reused every day. Behind this success is a vibrant global community that makes learning and collaboration easy for everyone, from absolute beginners to AI researchers. Python is also one of the best languages to start learning programming. Heres why: Learning Python opens doors to countless career paths from data analysis and web development to machine learning and cybersecurity. Its not just a language; its a key skill for thriving in a world shaped by technology. Even if you never become a professional programmer, understanding Python helps you automate tasks, analyze information, and think more logically valuable abilities in any field. Python is one of the most versatile tools you can learn it opens doors across nearly every industry. With solid Python skills, you can work in fields like software development, data analytics, machine learning, automation, web development, cybersecurity, or quality testing. But its reach goes far beyond IT. Python is increasingly used in finance, healthcare, education, science, and even the arts. Educators use it to teach logic and problem-solving, economists use it to analyze markets, psychologists to study behavior, and designers to automate creative workflows. Its also the language behind countless research projects, simulations, and AI-driven innovations shaping the modern world. As technology becomes part of nearly every profession, Python stands out as a universal language simple enough for beginners, yet powerful enough for experts. Whether youre managing data, automating reports, or exploring new ideas, Python helps you do it faster, smarter, and more creatively. Learn, certify, and succeed! Imagine writing your own apps, automating tasks, or even creating an AI-powered project all with Python. Its a versatile, multi-paradigm language trusted by innovators and global companies like Google, Meta, Cisco, and Netflix. With its clear, human-friendly syntax, Python is the perfect first language to learn and a powerful skill to master. Start your journey with the Python Essentials 1 course and prepare for the PCEP certification exam. Once youve learned the fundamentals, continue with Python Essentials 2 and prepare for the PCAP certification exam to deepen your programming skills. If youre ready to take your expertise even further, explore the professional-level courses and specialization paths that prepare you for PCPP, PCAD, PCAT, PCAA, and PCAS certifications your next step toward becoming an advanced, industry-ready Python professional. Back in 1999, Guido van Rossum the creator of Python outlined a simple yet visionary set of goals for his language. He wanted Python to be: More than two decades later, those goals have not only been achieved but surpassed. Python has become the common language of innovation powering everything from artificial intelligence and data science to web development, robotics, cybersecurity, and automation. Its used at NASA to analyze mission data, at Netflix to recommend what youll watch next, and at OpenAI to train intelligent models. Depending on which source you check, Python now ranks at or near the top of every major programming language index consistently holding first place in both the TIOBE Programming Community Index and the PYPL Popularity of Programming Languages Index. Python is no longer just a programming language its a global standard for teaching, learning, and creating technology. Mature, reliable, and constantly evolving, Python continues to prove that simplicity and power can go hand in hand. Investing your time in learning Python isnt just smart its future-proof. Sep 2025 1 2 3 4 5 Sep 2021 3 4 1 2 6 Where can we see Python in action? The short answer is: almost everywhere. From the apps on your phone to the systems that power global businesses, Python quietly runs behind the scenes, shaping how we search, shop, learn, and communicate online. Its the language behind complex Internet services such as search engines, cloud computing platforms, and social media networks. Every time you stream music, get directions, or ask a chatbot a question theres a good chance Python is part of what makes it all work. Python has become the go-to language for modern innovation. It powers artificial intelligence (AI) models, automates repetitive tasks, analyzes mountains of data, and supports the development of machine learning systems used in everything from voice assistants and image recognition to self-driving cars and recommendation engines. Whenever you interact with technologies like ChatGPT, Google Photos, or Netflixs content suggestions, Python is working in the background. Many of todays developer tools and cloud platforms are built using Python. Scientists and researchers rely on it for data analysis, visualization, and simulation, while software testers use it to automate and repeat test procedures efficiently. Educators love it for its simplicity, and engineers appreciate it for its power and flexibility. The list keeps growing every year. Python is a great choice for: And thats just the beginning Pythons versatility and community support ensure that new and exciting uses appear every day.

{"doc_id":"71bbcd80621798b2","title":"The History of Python: Python's Design Philosophy","content":"First of all, Python was originally conceived as a one-person skunkworks project there was no official budget, and I wanted results quickly, in part so that I could convince management to support the project (in which I was fairly successful). This led to a number of timesaving rules: - Borrow ideas from elsewhere whenever it makes sense. - Things should be as simple as possible, but no simpler. (Einstein) - Do one thing well (The \"UNIX philosophy\"). - Dont fret too much about performance--plan to optimize later when needed. - Dont fight the environment and go with the flow. - Dont try for perfection because good enough is often just that. - (Hence) its okay to cut corners sometimes, especially if you can do it right later. - The Python implementation should not be tied to a particular platform. Its okay if some functionality is not always available, but the core should work everywhere. - Dont bother users with details that the machine can handle (I didnt always follow this rule and some of the of the disastrous consequences are described in later sections). - Support and encourage platform-independent user code, but dont cut off access to platform capabilities or properties (This is in sharp contrast to Java.) - A large complex system should have multiple levels of extensibility. This maximizes the opportunities for users, sophisticated or not, to help themselves. - Errors should not be fatal. That is, user code should be able to recover from error conditions as long as the virtual machine is still functional. - At the same time, errors should not pass silently (These last two items naturally led to the decision to use exceptions throughout the implementation.) - A bug in the users Python code should not be allowed to lead to undefined behavior of the Python interpreter; a core dump is never the users fault. Although I will discuss more of ABC's influence on Python a little later, Id like to mention one readability rule specifically: punctuation characters should be used conservatively, in line with their common use in written English or high-school algebra. Exceptions are made when a particular notation is a long-standing tradition in programming languages, such as x*y for multiplication, a[i] for array subscription, or x.foo for attribute selection, but Python does not use $ to indicate variables, nor ! to indicate operations with side effects. Tim Peters, a long time Python user who eventually became its most prolific and tenacious core developer, attempted to capture my unstated design principles in what he calls the Zen of Python. I quote it here in its entirety: - Beautiful is better than ugly. - Explicit is better than implicit. - Simple is better than complex. - Complex is better than complicated. - Flat is better than nested. - Sparse is better than dense. - Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. - Although practicality beats purity. - Errors should never pass silently. - Unless explicitly silenced. - In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. - There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. - Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. - Now is better than never. - Although never is often better than right now. - If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. - If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. - Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! - The ABC group strived for perfection. For example, they used tree-based data structure algorithms that were proven to be optimal for asymptotically large collections (but were not so great for small collections). - The ABC group wanted to isolate the user, as completely as possible, from the big, bad world of computers out there. Not only should there be no limit on the range of numbers, the length of strings, or the size of collections (other than the total memory available), but users should also not be required to deal with files, disks, saving, or other programs. ABC should be the only tool they ever needed. This desire also caused the ABC group to create a complete integrated editing environment, unique to ABC (There was an escape possible from ABCs environment, for sure, but it was mostly an afterthought, and not accessible directly from the language.) - The ABC group assumed that the users had no prior computer experience (or were willing to forget it). Thus, alternative terminology was introduced that was considered more newbie-friendly than standard programming terms. For example, procedures were called how-tos and variables locations. - The ABC group designed ABC without an evolutionary path in mind, and without expecting user participation in the design of the language. ABC was created as a closed system, as flawless as its designers could make it. Users were not encouraged to look under the hood. Although there was talk of opening up parts of the implementation to advanced users in later stages of the project, this was never realized.","url":"http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/01/pythons-design-philosophy.html"}

Founded more than 2000 years ago, Paris is a modern and vibrant city with significant commercial, cultural, academic, scientific, administrative, business activity. From the Romans to the Vth Republic, Paris has a rich 2000 year history. See details of Paris history. The French Kings, who governed France, from 448 until 1848, commissioned many beautiful monuments, such as Versailles Palace and the Louvre Museum. The Catholic Church and Parisians built many great churches, including Notre Dame and Sainte Chapelle. Paris is a world capital city of shopping and fashion, with Channel, Dior, Vuitton, Yves Saint Laurent among many other top french fashion brands. The French tradition of good food still prevails in many restaurants, including gastronomic restaurants and excellent family style places. All of this turns Paris into a unique tourist city. Before Paris, the capital of France was Lyon (under the Romans). Paris first became the capital of France in 508 under King Clovis. After centuries with no unique capital of France, Paris retrieved its status of capital of France under King Philippe Auguste, who reigned between 1180 and 1223.

What is the landscape of Paris? Paris is the capital of what country? News Paris, city and capital of France, situated in the north-central part of the country. People were living on the site of the present-day city, located along the Seine River some 233 miles (375 km) upstream from the rivers mouth on the English Channel (La Manche), by about 7600 bce. The modern city has spread from the island (the le de la Cit) and far beyond both banks of the Seine. Paris occupies a central position in the rich agricultural region known as the Paris Basin, and it constitutes one of eight dpartements of the le-de-France administrative region. It is by far the countrys most important centre of commerce and culture. Area city, 41 square miles (105 square km); metropolitan area, 890 square miles (2,300 square km). (2020 est.) city, 2,145,906; (2020 est.) urban agglomeration, 10,858,874. Character of the city For centuries Paris has been one of the worlds most important and attractive cities. It is appreciated for the opportunities it offers for business and commerce, for study, for culture, and for entertainment; its gastronomy, haute couture, painting, literature, and intellectual community especially enjoy an enviable reputation. Its sobriquet the City of Light (la Ville Lumire), earned during the Enlightenment, remains appropriate, for Paris has retained its importance as a centre for education and intellectual pursuits. Pariss site at a crossroads of both water and land routes significant not only to France but also to Europe has had a continuing influence on its growth. Under Roman administration, in the 1st century bce, the original site on the le de la Cit was designated the capital of the Parisii tribe and territory. The Frankish king Clovis I had taken Paris from the Gauls by 494 ce and later made his capital there. Under Hugh Capet (ruled 987996) and the Capetian dynasty the preeminence of Paris was firmly established, and Paris became the political and cultural hub as modern France took shape. France has long been a highly centralized country, and Paris has come to be identified with a powerful central state, drawing to itself much of the talent and vitality of the provinces. The three main parts of historical Paris are defined by the Seine. At its centre is the le de la Cit, which is the seat of religious and temporal authority (the word cit connotes the nucleus of the ancient city). The Seines Left Bank (Rive Gauche) has traditionally been the seat of intellectual life, and its Right Bank (Rive Droite) contains the heart of the citys economic life, but the distinctions have become blurred in recent decades. The fusion of all these functions at the centre of France and, later, at the centre of an empire, resulted in a tremendously vital environment. In this environment, however, the emotional and intellectual climate that was created by contending powers often set the stage for great violence in both the social and political arenasthe years 1358, 1382, 1588, 1648, 1789, 1830, 1848, and 1871 being notable for such events. In its centuries of growth Paris has for the most part retained the circular shape of the early city. Its boundaries have spread outward to engulf the surrounding towns (bourgs), usually built around monasteries or churches and often the site of a market. From the mid-14th to the mid-16th century, the citys growth was mainly eastward; since then it has been westward. It comprises 20 arrondissements (municipal districts), each of which has its own mayor, town hall, and particular features. The numbering begins in the heart of Paris and continues in the spiraling shape of a snail shell, ending to the far east. Parisians refer to the arrondissements by number as the first (premier), second (deuxime), third (troisime), and so on. Adaptation to the problems of urbanizationsuch as immigration, housing, social infrastructure, public utilities, suburban development, and zoninghas produced the vast urban agglomeration. The Editors of Encyclopaedia BritannicaLandscape City site Paris is positioned at the centre of the le-de-France region, which is crossed by the Seine, Oise, and Marne rivers. The city is ringed with great forests of beech and oak; they are called the lungs of Paris, for they help to purify the air in the heavily industrialized region. The city proper is small; no corner is farther than about 6 miles (10 km) from the square in front of Notre-Dame Cathedral. It occupies a depression hollowed out by the Seine, and the surrounding heights have been respected as the limits of the city. Elevation varies from 430 feet (130 metres) at the butte of Montmartre, in the north, to 85 feet (26 metres) in the Grenelle area, in the southwest. The Seine flows for about 8 miles (13 km) through the centre of the city and 10 of the 20 arrondissements. It enters the city at the southeast corner, flows northwestward, and turns gradually southwestward, eventually leaving Paris at the southwest corner. As a result, what starts out as the streams east bank becomes its north bank and ends as the west bank, and the Parisians therefore adopted the simple, unchanging designation of Right Bank and Left Bank (when facing downstream). Specific places, however, are usually indicated by arrondissement or by quarter (quartier). At water level, some 30 feet (9 metres) below street level, the river is borderedat least on those portions not transformed into expresswaysby cobbled quays graced with trees and shrubs. From street level another line of trees leans toward the water. Between the two levels, the retaining walls, usually made of massive stone blocks, are decorated with the great iron rings once used to moor merchant vessels, and some are pierced by openings left by water gates for old palaces or inspection ports for subways, sewers, and underpasses. At intermittent points the walls are shawled in ivy. The garden effect of the Seines open waters and its tree-lined banks foster in part the appearance of Paris as a city well-endowed with green spaces. Tens of thousands of trees (mostly plane trees, with a scattering of chestnuts) line the streets as well, and numerous public parks, gardens, and squares dot the city. Most of the parks and gardens of the modern central city are on land that formerly was reserved for the kings on the old citys outskirts. Under Napoleon III, who had been impressed by Londons parks while living in Britain, two ancient royal military preserves at the approaches to Paris were made into English parksthe Bois de Boulogne to the west and the Bois de Vincennes to the east. Moreover, during his reign a large area of land was laid out in promenades and garden squares. Under Mayor Jacques Chirac in the late 20th century, the municipal government initiated efforts to create new parks, and such projects continued into the 21st century. The Promenade Plante is a partially elevated parkway built along an abandoned rail line and viaduct in the 12th arrondissement (municipal district) of Paris, on the right bank of the Seine River. It was the worlds first elevated park (first phase completed in 1994) and the first green space constructed on a viaduct; it has since inspired other cities to turn abandoned rail lines into public parkland. The entire feature runs some 4.5 km (about 3 miles) from the Opra Bastille to the Bois de Vincennes. Located underneath the elevated portion is the Viaduc des Arts, which stretches along the Avenue Daumesnil. Its former archways house specialized commercial establishments.","url":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Paris"}
{"doc_id":"4f000beecaeffebc","title":"Alexander Graham Bell: Telephone & Inventions | HISTORY","content":"Legal Headaches The inventor faced a nearly 20-year legal battle with other scientists, including Gray and Meucci, who claimed they created telephone prototypes prior to Bells patent. government moved to withdraw the patent issued to Bell, but after a series of rulings, the Bell company won in a Supreme Court decision. While the Bell Company faced over 550 court challenges, in the end, none were successful. Inventions and Accomplishments In addition to the telephone, Bell worked on hundreds of projects throughout his career and received patents in various fields. Some of his other notable inventions were: The metal detector: Bell initially came up with this device to locate a bullet inside of assassinated President James A. Photophone: The photophone allowed transmission of speech on a beam of light. Graphophone: This improved version of the phonograph could record and play back sound. Audiometer: This gadget was used to detect hearing problems. In 1880, Bell was awarded the French Volta Prize, and with the money, he founded a facility devoted to scientific discovery, the Volta Laboratory in Washington, D.C. Quotes by Bell While Bell is typically known for what he invented, hes also remembered for what he said and wrote. Some famous quotes attributed to Bell include: When one door closes another door opens; but we so often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door, that we do not see the ones which open for us. A man's own judgment should be the final appeal in all that relates to himself. Before anything else, preparation is the key to success. Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand. The suns rays do not burn until brought to focus. Great discoveries and improvements invariably involve the cooperation of many minds. The most successful men in the end are those whose success is the result of steady accretion. The only difference between success and failure is the ability to take action. You cannot force ideas. Successful ideas are the result of slow growth. The inventor looks upon the world and is not contented with things as they are. He wants to improve whatever he sees, he wants to benefit the world; he is haunted by an idea. The spirit of invention possesses him, seeking materialization.","url":"https://www.history.com/articles/alexander-graham-bell"}
{"doc_id":"1cfef7389940a389","title":"1870s – 1940s: Telephone | Imagining the Internet | Elon University","content":"This timeline is provided to help show how the dominant form of communication changes as rapidly as innovators develop new technologies. A brief historical overview: The printing press was the big innovation in communications until the telegraph was developed. Printing remained the key format for mass messages for years afterward, but the telegraph allowed instant communication over vast distances for the first time in human history. Telegraph usage faded as radio became easy to use and popularized; as radio was being developed, the telephone quickly became the fastest way to communicate person-to-person; after television was perfected and content for it was well developed, it became the dominant form of mass-communication technology; the internet came next, and newspapers, radio, telephones, and television are being rolled into this far-reaching information medium. Development of the Telephone World Changes Due to the Telephone Telephone Predictions The Development of the Telephone As with many innovations, the idea for the telephone came along far sooner than it was brought to reality. While Italian innovator Antonio Meucci (pictured at left) is credited with inventing the first basic phone in 1849, and Frenchman Charles Bourseul devised a phone in 1854, Alexander Graham Bell won the first U.S. patent for the device in 1876. Bell began his research in 1874 and had financial backers who gave him the best business plan for bringing it to market. In 1877-78, the first telephone line was constructed, the first switchboard was created and the first telephone exchange was in operation. Three years later, almost 49,000 telephones were in use. In 1880, Bell (in the photo below) merged this company with others to form the American Bell Telephone Company and in 1885 American Telegraph and Telephone Company (AT&T) was formed; it dominated telephone communications for the next century. At one point in time, Bell System employees purposely denigrated the U.S. telephone system to drive down stock prices of all phone companies and thus make it easier for Bell to acquire smaller competitors. By 1900 there were nearly 600,000 phones in Bells telephone system; that number shot up to 2.2 million phones by 1905, and 5.8 million by 1910. In 1915 the transcontinental telephone line began operating. By 1907, AT&T had a near monopoly on phone and telegraph service, thanks to its purchase of Western Union. Its president, Theodore Vail, urged at the time that a monopoly could most efficiently operate the nations far-flung communications network. At the urging of the public and AT&T competitors, the government began to investigate the company for anti-trust violations, thus forcing the 1913 Kingsbury Commitment, an agreement between AT&T vice president Nathan Kingsbury and the office of the U.S. Under this commitment, AT&T agreed to divest itself of Western Union and provide long-distance services to independent phone exchanges. During World War I, the government nationalized telephone and telegraph lines in the United States from June 1918 to July 1919, when, after a joint resolution of Congress, President Wilson issued an order putting them under the direction of the U.S. A year later, the systems were returned to private ownership, AT&T resumed its monopolistic hold, and by 1934 the government again acted, this time agreeing to allow it to operate as a regulated monopoly under the jurisdiction of the FCC. Public utility commissions in state and local jurisdictions were appointed regulators of AT&T and the nations independent phone companies, while the FCC regulated long-distance services conducted across state lines. They set the rates the phone companies could charge and determined what services and equipment each could offer. This stayed in effect until AT&Ts forced divestiture in 1984, the conclusion of a U.S. Department of Justice anti-trust suit that had been filed in 1974. The all-powerful company had become popularly known and disparaged as Ma Bell. AT&Ts local operations were divided into seven independent Regional Bell Operating Companies, known as the Baby Bells. AT&T became a long-distance-services company. By 1948, the 30 millionth phone was connected in the United States; by the 1960s, there were more than 80 million phone hookups in the U.S. and 160 million in the world; by 1980, there were more than 175 million telephone subscriber lines in the U.S. In 1993, the first digital cellular network went online in Orlando, Florida; by 1995 there were 25 million cellular phone subscribers, and that number exploded at the turn of the century, with digital cellular phone service expected to replace land-line phones for most U.S. customers by as early as 2010. World Changes Due to the Telephone Within 50 years of its invention, the telephone had become an indispensable tool in the United States. In the late 19th century, people raved about the telephones positive aspects and ranted about what they anticipated would be negatives. Their key points, recorded by Ithiel de Sola Pool in his 1983 book Forecasting the Telephone, mirror nearly precisely what was later predicted about the impact of the internet. For example, people said the telephone would: help further democracy; be a tool for grassroots organizers; lead to additional advances in networked communications; allow social decentralization, resulting in a movement out of cities and more flexible work arrangements; change marketing and politics; alter the ways in which wars are fought; cause the postal service to lose business; open up new job opportunities; allow more public feedback; make the world smaller, increasing contact between peoples of all nations and thus fostering world peace; increase crime and aid criminals; be an aid for physicians, police, fire, and emergency workers; be a valuable tool for journalists; bring people closer together, decreasing loneliness and building new communities; inspire a decline in the art of writing; have an impact on language patterns and introduce new words; and someday lead to an advanced form of the transmission of intelligence. Privacy was also a major concern. As is the case with the Internet, the telephone worked to improve privacy while simultaneously leaving people open to invasions of their privacy. In the beginning days of the telephone, people would often have to journey to the local general store or some other central point to be able to make and receive calls. Most homes werent wired together, and eavesdroppers could hear you conduct your personal business as you used a public phone. Switchboard operators who connected the calls would also regularly invade peoples privacy. The early house-to-house phone systems were often party lines on which a number of families would receive calls, and others were free to listen in and often chose to do so. Today, while most homes are wired and people can travel freely, conducting their phone conversations wirelessly, wiretapping and other surveillance methods can be utilized to listen in on their private business. Peoples privacy can also be interrupted by unwanted phone calls from telemarketers and others who wish to profit in some way just as Internet e-mail accounts receive unwanted sales pitches, known as spam. Yet, the invention of the telephone also worked to increase privacy in many ways. It permitted people to exchange information without having to put it in writing, and a call on the phone came to replace such intrusions on domestic seclusion as unexpected visits from relatives or neighbors and the pushy patter of door-to-door salesmen. The same could be said for the Internet privacy has been enhanced in some ways because e-mail and instant messaging have reduced the frequency of the jangling interruptions previously dished out by our telephones. Past Predictions About the Future of the Telephone President Rutherford B. Hayes to Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 on viewing the telephone for the first time: Thats an amazing invention, but who would ever want to use one of them? Bell offered to sell his telephone patent to Western Union for $100,000 in 1876, when he was struggling with the business. An account that is believed by some to be apocryphal, but still recounted in many telephone histories states that the committee appointed to investigate the offer filed the following report: We do not see that this device will be ever capable of sending recognizable speech over a distance of several miles. Messer Hubbard and Bell want to install one of their telephone devices in every city. The idea is idiotic on the face of it. Furthermore, why would any person want to use this ungainly and impractical device when he can send a messenger to the telegraph office and have a clear written message sent to any large city in the United States? Mr. Hubbards fanciful predictions, while they sound rosy, are based on wild-eyed imagination and lack of understanding of the technical and economic facts of the situation, and a posture of ignoring the obvious limitations of his device, which is hardly more than a toy This device is inherently of no use to us. We do not recommend its purchase. As reported in the book Bell by Robert V. Bruce, Kate Field, a British reporter who knew Bell, predicted in 1878 that eventually: While two persons, hundreds of miles apart, are talking together, they will actually see each other. Sir William Preece, chief engineer for the British Post Office, 1878, as reported in The Telephone in a Changing World by Marion May Dilts: There are conditions in America which necessitate the use of such instruments more than here. Here we have a superabundance of messengers, errand boys and things of that kind The absence of servants has compelled America to adopt communications systems for domestic purposes.

{"doc_id":"a2f9c41db2f29751","title":"The Story Behind the World’s First Telephone – The Historic England Blog","content":"Scottish-born Alexander Graham Bell (1847 to 1922), developed the worlds first working telephone, receiving a patent from the United States Patent Office 7 March 1876. Reputedly, the very first successful words using his new instrument, as Bell called it, were spoken by him to his associate Thomas Watson who was out of earshot in another room: Mr Watson, come here I want to see you. Bells family background a grandfather, father and uncle all elocutionists; a mother and wife who were deaf led him to obsessively research hearing and speech. Eventually, his work with deaf people and years of experimentation into acoustics and the human voice culminated in the momentous invention that changed the world. Here we look at the sometimes controversial life of this remarkable scientist and inventor. Please note: some of Bells views on Deaf people and Deafness are controversial and considered incorrect and offensive today. Some people might find these views distressing, so please read with discretion. The early life of Alexander Graham Bell Alexander Bell was unexceptional at his Scottish school, Weston House Academy in Elgin, but became a fine self-taught pianist and had a clever inquiring mind. At 12 years old he invented a simple device to dehusk wheat, using nail brushes, that a neighbour employed in his grain mill. In 1862, he left school at 15, moving to London, partly to escape from his over-bearing father, but also to care for his grandfather who encouraged his precocious intellect and sharpened his mind through serious discussion. Bell later returned to Weston House, becoming first a teacher of elocution and music and then as assistant master. In his spare time he experimented with electricity to transmit sound. He later briefly attended the University of Edinburgh, studying anatomy and physiology. Early experiments with sound Bells mothers hearing had started to fail when she was a child. The young Bell developed a method of talking in a deep resonant way close to her ear which helped her to hear, sparking his later research into acoustics. Bells father an eminent elocutionist and author on the subject encouraged his sons interest in speech and sound. Inspired by an automated talking head that they had been to see, the teenage Bell and his brother Melville (who later opened his own elocution school) made their own. It appeared to say mama when air was blown into it as Bell worked the lips. They also created a living talking dog by teaching the family terrier to growl on command, then manipulating the pets lips so the animal seemed to say how are you grandmama? Bell began helping his father at Visible Speech demonstrations. The elder Bell had developed a method of translating sounds made by the human voice into a series of written symbols in order to teach deaf people to speak (oralism). The symbols indicated how to use and shape the tongue and mouth. Moving to Canada Bells younger brother Edward had died of tuberculosis Spring 1867. Three years later, his older brother Melville died of the same disease. Now, with Bell himself ill with tuberculosis, his bereaved parents decided to relocate the surviving family to a healthier climate, buying a farm near Brantford, Ontario. The 23 year old Bell moved to Canada very reluctantly, having had some success in London working with pupils who were then described as Deaf-Mute an archaic term, now considered offensive, that meant a person who was unable to hear or speak. Bell continued using the Visible Speech method, set up a workshop and pursued his experiments into sound. Working with deafness In 1871, Bell took up a post at the Boston School, successfully teaching the Visible Speech system, then moved on to teach the same programme at the American Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb the first school for the deaf in America and the Clarke Institution for the Deaf-Mutes. A year later he set up in private practice in Boston the School of Vocal Physiology and Mechanics of Speech attracting a large number of pupils. Bell became a US citizen in 1882. At the time, the prevailing philosophy about deafness was that to speak was to be human and that deaf people unfortunates should learn to speak in order to fully engage with society. Communication by sign language was mostly prohibited by teachers and often punished. Oralism was perceived as the right way forward. Thus Bell, while genuinely committed to helping deaf people, encouraged speech therapy and lip reading over sign language. He infamously said: We should try ourselves to forget that they are deaf. We should try to teach them to forget they are deaf. His approach is still highly controversial and divisive within the Deaf community to this day. Bells benefactors During this period of his life, Bell became exhausted and unwell trying to juggle teaching with his continuing research into sound. As a result, he largely gave up his private practice to concentrate on his experiments. Bell kept on two deaf pupils: 6 year old Georgie Sanders and 15 year old Mabel Hubbard. They both had wealthy fathers, Thomas Sanders and Gardiner Greene Hubbard, later becoming Bells patrons and friends and financially supporting his research. Bell grew gradually closer to his pupil Mabel, 10 years his junior, and she to him, eventually marrying July 1877. They had four children: two sons who died shortly after birth and two daughters, Elsie and Marian. Bell experiments with improving the telegraph From around the mid-19th century, before Bells invention of the telephone, communication over distance was by means of the electric telegraph, which allowed the wire transmission of text messages more rapidly than the sending of letters. It used an electric current to move magnetic needles to transmit a message in code, translated at the other end by a skilled operator Bell had long been investigating the harmonic telegraph trying to make this conventional telegraphy more sophisticated in order to transmit several messages simultaneously, using tuned electronic metal reeds, to send/receive multiple frequencies along a single wire, avoiding the cost of constructing new lines. This led him to conclude that there might be a way to transmit the human voice by telegraph over a wire an acoustic telegraph. The invention of the telephone Bell did not have sufficient technical knowledge to develop his idea, but a chance meeting with a clever 20 year old electrical engineer Thomas Watson (1854-1934) in a Boston, Massachusetts, electrical shop changed everything Backed by Sanders and Hubbards money (Hubbard wanted to break Western Unions monopoly of the telegraph), in 1875 the pair worked together in Boston on the acoustic telegraph and the telephone. On 14 February 1876, Bells lawyer applied for a patent at the US Patent Office for transmitting vocal or other sounds, even though as yet there was no working telephone. Securing a patent for the telephone On the exact same day that Bell filed for his patent, 14 February, another inventor working on the acoustic telegraph, Elisha Gray, filed for a similar patent. His used water to transmit sound. He also had no working telephone. But it was Bell who was finally granted the patent three weeks later. There is continuing controversy about whose application arrived first and was the most valid, as well as whether Bell misappropriated Grays idea of using liquid as a transmitter three days after being awarded the patent, Bell succeeded in getting his telephone to work. The very first words using his new instrument, as Bell called it, transcribed in his lab notes, were spoken by him to Thomas Watson who was out of earshot in another room: Mr Watson, come here I want to see you. Over the following nearly 20 years, the Bell Telephone Company founded July 1877 (later AT&T), successfully fought off 587 challenges to Bells patent. Bells development of the telephone The American Philadelphia Centennial was an enormous 19th-century world fair showcasing new inventions including typewriters, sewing machines and Heinz ketchup. It opened in May 1876. Here, in public, Bell successfully demonstrated his prototype telephone, proving that it worked. Back in Boston, reunited with Watson, the pair continued experimenting, gradually extending the distance over which the telephone would work. A continuing series of countrywide lectures and demonstrations followed. Interest in the telephone grew rapidly, both with the public and in the wider scientific community. Within three months of Bell, Hubbard, Sanders and Watson founding the Bell Telephone Company, July 1877, to commercialise the telephone, around 1,300 devices were in operation in America. By New Year 1880, there were 30,000. However, Bells interest in the telephone waned in the early 1880s. He was already wealthy. He sold off most of his holdings in the Bell Telephone Company and, by the mid-1880s, his role in the telephone industry was peripheral. In 1888, Bell became a founding member of the National Geographic Society, and was its president three years later. His restlessly inventive mind wanted to keep pushing forwards the boundaries of scientific knowledge: Some of Alexander Bells other inventions In 1888, Bell became a founding member of the National Geographic Society, and was its president three years later. His restlessly inventive mind needed more challenges: He created, among other inventions, a metal detector that was later used to locate bullets and shrapnel in wounded soldiers during the Boer War (1899 to 1902) and the First World War (1914 to 1918), as well as the AEA Silver Dart bi-plane, and designs for winged hydrofoil boats that could zip across water at high speed. He also designed the aileron a key part of aircraft manoeuvrability, helping it bank left or right. The telephone comes to Britain Bells fame spread round the world, to such an extent that he was invited to demonstrate his telephone to Queen Victoria at Osborne House, Isle of Wight, 14 January 1878.","url":"https://heritagecalling.com/2022/07/29/the-story-behind-the-worlds-first-telephone/"}
{"doc_id":"f0529b1c4ed5756b","title":"10 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started ‘Assassin’s Creed Shadows’","content":"While this may be coming a bit late, without bothering to get a review copy, I started Assassins Creed Shadows at the same time as most other people. But given that this is my job, Ive managed to put 40 hours in already, and Ive learned a few things. Here are ten things I wish I knew when I started Assassins Creed Shadows 1) Check The Castle Type Before Invading You can check which type of castle, for Naoe or for Yasuke, the game recommends by looking at its reward, and seeing if its for him or her. A Naoe castle will have more sneaking zones and small entryways, a Yasuke one will have gates to crash and sometimes big boxes to move. However, given how much of a combat monster Yasuke is, I end up using him to blitz through either kind of castle most of the time. That is harder with Naoe. 2) Stay On Your Horse, Avoid The Woods In terms of navigation, this game does not want you to take shortcuts most of the time. I would almost always use your horse and the path tracker when going nearly anywhere. The woods are dense and the hills are steep off the main paths, and it will be more trouble than its worth. Follow the winding directions on horses and you will always get there faster. 3) Dont Forget The Hidden Skill Tree Passive This is easy to miss because it doesnt look like a normal skill slot and you cant put points into it. But at the bottom of every skill tree there will be a circle that shows you that you will get increased damage or health or things like that the more points you put into a tree. Jam points in there to get things like the 50% damage boost I now have on bow and naginata because I make sure to also do points on the left side row of perks, which will account for a lot of them. 4) Dont Forget Double or Triple Unlock Skill Perks - This is easy to miss. A number of upgrades will have a little dot or two above them. This means they can be upgraded multiple times, and for skills especially, these can be big damage boosts, sometimes 100% more damage if you remember to hit those nodes. 5) Always Do Your Contracts Contracts refresh each season, are incredibly easy and usually close by. They give you a lot of upgrade materials for your base, your gear or just money, and if youre short on any of that, never miss them. 6) Dont Bother Smuggling With Scouts That leads me to my next point, dont bother using scouts to tag materials in enemy zones. They dont give you that much, contracts are much more useful, and you should be saving your scouts mainly to find quest locations or occasionally, reset your wanted level. 7) Get Unblockable Counter Gear/Perks While there are many styles of play in the game, I cannot live without giving the ability to parry unblockable attacks to both characters. For Yasuke, thats a chestplate called Protectors Armor found in Nijo Palace in Kyoto you can get very early. For Naoe, its not gear, but a Katana perk, though you need the final row of knowledge point upgrades to unlock that one, which takes a long time. 8) Ditch Old Gear Instead Of Always Upgrading I made the mistake of trying to upgrade all my favorite gear endlessly, but you will quickly run out of materials for that. Do not be afraid to ditch old gear, even legendary gear, for rares or epics because higher levels will give you flat stat boosts that are hugely important. If you cant live without a legendary, fine, focus on upgrading that one. 9) Get Legendary Blacksmith Mods This requires a max Blacksmith upgrade at base, but it lets you take legendary mods from gear and put them in other gears slots. For instance, that unblockable parry perk from Yasukes armor can then be put into any other armor along with the original base perk. 10) Dont Forget To Transmog This is easy to miss, but making your guys look awesome is a great aspect of the game. You can delete gear and still have those styles unlocked. Most legendary gear will have its own unique look, but even lower tier gear can be some of the best in the game (the mask everyone always asks me about for one).

On Thursday, developer Rockstar Games announced the game has been delayed to Nov. GTA 6 had previously been targeted for a 2025 release date before it was originally delayed to May 26, 2026. GTA 6 has been highly anticipated, in part because the previous entry in the series was released in September 2013. The 13-year gap between releases is the longest the series has ever experienced. Set in the fictional state of Leonida, GTA 6 follows the adventures of criminal couple Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos. Players will be able to control both characters as they roam Leonida, which includes a return to the titular metropolis of 2002's Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. As of 2025, GTA V was the second-highest-selling video game of all time, with publisher Take Two Interactive saying the game had moved 220 million units.","url":"https://www.espn.com/gaming/story/_/id/46874180/grand-theft-auto-6-vi-release-date-delay"}
{"doc_id":"9362e23544a9b267","title":"Grand Theft Auto VI - Rockstar Games","content":"Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive. Jason wants an easy life, but things just keep getting harder. Jason grew up around grifters and crooks. After a stint in the Army trying to shake off his troubled teens, he found himself in the Keys doing what he knows best, working for local drug runners. It might be time to try something new. If anything happens, I'm right behind you. Another day in paradise, right? Meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him. Jason knows how he'd like it to turn out but right now, it's hard to tell. Lucias father taught her to fight as soon as she could walk. Life has been coming at her swinging ever since. Fighting for her family landed her in the Leonida Penitentiary. Sheer luck got her out. Lucias learned her lesson only smart moves from here. More than anything, Lucia wants the good life her mom has dreamed of since their days in Liberty City but instead of half-baked fantasies, Lucia is prepared to take matters into her own hands. The only thing that matters is who you know and what you got. Fresh out of prison and ready to change the odds in her favor, Lucias committed to her plan no matter what it takes. A life with Jason could be her way out. Only in Leonida When the sun fades and the neon glows, everyone has something to gain and more to lose. What if everything on the internet was true? Jasons friend and a fellow associate of Brians, Cal feels safest hanging at home, snooping on Coast Guard comms with a few beers and some private browser tabs open. There are way too many birds flying around in perfect formation. The psychopaths are in charge. Cal is at the low tide of America and happy there. Casual paranoia loves company, but his friend Jason has bigger plans. Tour a few of the must-see destinations across the sunshine state. It's all about heart the Jack of Hearts. Boobie is a local Vice City legend and acts like it. One of the few to transform his time in the streets into a legitimate empire spanning real estate, a strip club, and a recording studio Boobie's all smiles until it's time to talk business. The club money pay for the studio, and the drug money pay for it all. Boobie might seem like he's just out for himself, but it's his partnership with the young aspiring music mogul Dre'Quan for Only Raw Records that he's most invested in now they just need a hit. Records Dre'Quan was always more of a hustler than a gangster. Even when he was dealing on the streets to make ends meet, breaking into music was the goal. Dancers are like my A&Rs. If the record's a hit, DJs gonna be spinnin' it. You're with the label now. Now that he's signed the Real Dimez, Dre'Quan's days of booking acts into Boobie's strip club might be numbered as he sets his sights on the Vice City scene. Bae-Luxe and Roxy aka Real Dimez have been friends since high school girls with the savvy to turn their time shaking down local dealers into cold, hard cash via spicy rap tracks and a relentless social media presence. All my dimes in this club. Meet my twin, make it a dub. One hit away from fame. An early hit single with local rapper DWNPLY took Real Dimez to new heights. Now, after five years and a whole lot of trouble, theyre signed to Only Raw Records, hoping lightning can strike twice. Confidence, charm, and cunning Rauls a seasoned bank robber always on the hunt for talent ready to take the risks that bring the biggest rewards. Life is full of surprises, my friend. I think we'd all be wise to remember that. A professional adapts. Raul's recklessness raises the stakes with every score. Sooner or later, his crew will have to double down or pull their chips from the table. Nothing better than a Mudslide at sunset. Brian's a classic drug runner from the golden age of smuggling in the Keys. Still moving product through his boat yard with his third wife, Lori, Brian's been around long enough to let others do his dirty work. I hauled so much grass in that plane, I could make the state of Leonida levitate. Looks like a Leonida beach bum moves like a great white shark.

{"doc_id":"a10cf69ddd1c09b6","title":"President Donald J. Trump","content":"After a landslide election victory in 2024, President Donald J. Trump is returning to the White House to build upon his previous successes and use his mandate to reject the extremist policies of the radical left while providing tangible quality of life improvements for the American people. This includes putting a stop to endless wars, defending our nations borders, and unleashing the potential of the American economy, affording ALL Americans the opportunity to pursue THEIR version of the American dream. In his first administration, President Trump passed record-setting tax cuts and regulation cuts, achieved energy independence, replaced NAFTA with the United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, invested $2 trillion to completely rebuild the Military, launched the Space Force, obliterated the ISIS Caliphate, achieved a major breakthrough for peace in the Middle East, passed the most significant Veterans Affairs reforms in half a century, confirmed over 250 federal judges, including 3 Supreme Court Justices, signed bipartisan Criminal Justice Reform, lowered drug prices, protected Medicare and Social Security, and secured our nations borders in his first four years in office. This was only the beginning. Trump defines the American success story. Throughout his life he has continually set the standards of business and entrepreneurial excellence, especially in real estate, sports, and entertainment. President Trump built on his success in private life when he entered into politics and public service. He remarkably won the Presidency in his first ever run for any political office. He won a second time despite several assassination attempts and the unprecedented weaponization of law fare against him. Time after time President Trump has defied the odds because he fundamentally believes in the exceptionalism of the American spirit and wants to see our great country succeed. A graduate of the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School of Finance, President Trump followed in his fathers footsteps into the world of real estate development, making his mark in New York City. There, the Trump name soon became synonymous with the most prestigious of addresses in Manhattan and, subsequently, throughout the world. President Trump is also an accomplished author. He has written more than fourteen bestsellers. His first book, The Art of the Deal, is considered a business classic. President Trump has five children, Barron, Don Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany, as well as 11 grandchildren.","url":"https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/"}

Thousands of supporters gathered outside Dhakas main airport and along the road leading to her house to welcome Zia, who has spent recent years in and out of hospital. She was seen sitting in a wheelchair at the airport. The 78-year-old BNP leader smiled as she repeatedly raised her right hand to receive greetings. A three-time prime minister twice for full five-year terms and once for just a few months and Hasinas chief political rival was convicted in 2018 and sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison on charges of fund embezzlement from charitable trusts. The charges were brought during Hasinas rule and were widely viewed by the BNP as politically motivated. In January, Bangladeshs Supreme Court acquitted Zia, overturning a 10-year sentence and clearing her of any wrongdoing. The ruling followed a separate November 2024 acquittal in another high-profile case, in which Zia had been accused of misappropriating more than $260,000 from a second trust during her last term in office. Election date While Zia had already been released from prison, her arrival in Bangladesh will intensify calls on the interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, to announce a clear date for national elections. Bangladeshs authorities have pledged to hold elections by either December this year or June next year, depending on the pace of reforms. Zia is the widow of former military ruler Ziaur Rahman, assassinated in 1981, and became the countrys first female prime minister, and one of the first women world leaders from South Asia. Zias elder son, Tarique Rahman, leads the BNP as acting chief from exile in London. Hasina, the last elected prime minister, is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who led Bangladeshs war of independence from Pakistan in 1971.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/6/bangladeshs-khaleda-zia-returns-elections"}
{"doc_id":"4fbc71bd9fd3671f","title":"Khaleda Zia | Biography & Facts | Britannica","content":"Khaleda Zia News Khaleda Zia (born August 15, 1945, Dinjpur, East Bengal, India [now in Bangladesh]) is a Bangladeshi politician who served as prime minister of Bangladesh in 199196 and 200106. She was the first woman to serve as prime minister of the country, and she governed during a period of natural disasters, economic distress, and civil unrest. Khaleda was the third of five children born to Taiyaba and Iskandar Majumdar, a businessman. In 1960 she passed the government matriculation exam and later attended Surendranath College in Dinjpur. In 1959 she married Zia ur-Rahman, a leader in the fight for the independence of Bangladesh, then part of Pakistan. During the struggle in 1971 she was kept under house arrest, though she remained largely uninterested in politics, even after her husband became president of Bangladesh in 1977. After her husband was assassinated in 1981 by military officers, she became politically active, and in 1984 she assumed the leadership of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Khaleda was arrested repeatedly during the dictatorship of Hussein Mohammad Ershad in the 1980s, but in 1991 she led the opposition to victory and became prime minister. During Khaledas first term she attempted to tackle the countrys dire economic problems by privatizing industry and encouraging private investment; her government also focused on improving the countrys educational system and expanding the economic opportunities available to women. Her efforts were hampered, however, by a cyclone in 1991 that killed more than 130,000 people and caused more than $2 billion in damage. In February 1996 she overwhelmingly won a second term in office, but her victory was tainted by an opposition-led boycott of the election; heeding the call of opposition groups, which claimed that the government would rig the outcome in its favour, roughly nine-tenths of eligible voters abstained. After a wave of strikes and protests, she resigned the following month. In 2001 Khaleda regained power, promising to eliminate both corruption and terrorism. Both, however, remained problematic throughout her second term. She stepped down at the end of 2006, passing authority to a caretaker administration until elections could be held. - In full: - Khaleda Zia ur-Rahman - Ne: - Khaleda Majumdar - Born: - August 15, 1945, Dinjpur, East Bengal, India [now in Bangladesh] (age 80) - Title / Office: - prime minister (2001-2006), Bangladesh - prime minister (1991-1996), Bangladesh - Political Affiliation: - Bangladesh Nationalist Party In January 2007 a state of emergency was declared in Bangladesh, and an army-backed government took power. It subsequently launched an antigraft campaign, and in September Khaleda was arrested on corruption charges. In 2014 she and others went on trial for embezzling funds intended for a charity. She was convicted in February 2018 and began serving a five-year sentence, which rendered her unable to contest elections later in the year. Khaleda denied any wrongdoing, claiming the verdict was politically motivated. In October she was convicted on additional charges of graft, while her February conviction was upheld and the sentence was extended to 10 years. That same month her son was sentenced in absentia to life in prison. Khaledas health began to decline in April 2019, and in March 2020 she was released from prison on a temporary basis while undergoing medical treatment.","url":"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Khaleda-Zia"}

Bangladesh has released Begum Khaleda Zia, the chair of the main opposition party, from house arrest, the presidents office announced.

She has denied the charges against her. Zia was an archrival of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, 76, who resigned and fled the country on Monday. On Tuesday, President Mohammed Shahabuddin announced Zias release from house arrest and dissolved parliament after calls from the student-led national movement. Zia had led the BNP since 1981 after her husband, then-president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in an attempted military coup. She became Bangladeshs first woman prime minister a decade later. Despite having ruled between 1991 and 1996 and from 2001 to 2006, Zias terms in office were marred by corruption allegations. As part of a deal to allow Zia to resume political life, her two sons also accused of corruption during her second term relocated to the United Kingdom. The announcement of her release came after the army chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, was meeting student leaders to discuss the formation of an interim government that is expected to hold elections soon after it takes over. Meanwhile, the countrys key police association on Tuesday apologised for actions against innocent students during the crackdown on protesters and demanded the release of its jailed officers. Until the security of every member of the police is secured, we are declaring a strike, the Bangladesh police association said in a statement. It argued its officers had been forced to open fire, and that they had been cast as the villain. The families of political prisoners jailed in Bangladesh under Hasina waited desperately for news of their relatives, as some of those missing were released. Among the most prominent of those released on Tuesday was opposition activist and lawyer Ahmad Bin Quasem, a British-educated barrister son of Mir Quasem Ali, the former leader of Jamaat-e-Islami who was hanged in 2016 after his final appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court. Security forces during Hasinas rule were accused of detaining tens of thousands of opposition activists, killing hundreds in extrajudicial encounters, and disappearing their leaders and supporters. Human Rights Watch last year said security forces had committed more than 600 enforced disappearances since Hasina came to power in 2009, and nearly 100 people remain unaccounted for. Hasinas government denied the allegations, saying some of those reported missing drowned in the Mediterranean while trying to reach Europe. We need answers, Sanjida Islam Tulee, coordinator of Mayer Daak, told the AFP news agency. The group, whose name translates as The Call of the Mothers, has been campaigning for the release of detained people.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/6/bangladesh-frees-hasina-rival-khaleda-zia-from-house-arrest"}
{"doc_id":"2b9747095a0d9c68","title":"Political transition in Bangladesh may move the country away from a dark chapter, but risks of mass violence against civilians remain - United States Holocaust Memorial Museum","content":"In November 2017, the Simon-Skjodt Center released a report that detailed concerns about the risk of mass atrocities in Bangladesh, with a particular focus on the countrys December 2018 elections. The report found that the risk of mass atrocities centered around political competition between the ruling Awami League party, led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) opposition alliance. Some violent incidents occurred around the elections, but mass killings of civilians did not. The Awami Leagues electoral victory and consolidation of political power, and the shrinking space for political opposition and civil society, however, threatened the future of democracy in the country. In the summer of 2024, when student protesters took to the streets to oppose government policies and express growing dissatisfaction, the Bangladeshi government responded violently. The governments response led to growing public pressure for change. On August 5, 2024, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country. Days later, an interim government was formed, headed by Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus. Ali Riaz, an expert on Bangladeshi politics at Illinois State University, shares his analysis of mass atrocity risks facing civilians in Bangladesh after the transition. The Simon-Skjodt Center previously found that mass atrocity risks in Bangladesh were rooted in political competition between the Awami League and the BNP. In your opinion, what are the most significant risks today? The situation has further deteriorated since your last analysis, as the politics in Bangladesh has become more polarized in the previous years under the Sheikh Hasina regime. Hasinas Awami League party deepened political and social divisions to help it dominate politics. As the Hasina regime became more dependent on brute force, it used the state apparatuses and its party activists to confront any dissent. Law enforcement agencies and Bangladesh Awami League (AL) activists killed approximately 500 people and injured thousands more between mid-July and August 5, 2024. Revamping the law enforcement agencies and holding members of the security forces accountable for crimes will help regain respect and minimize the distance between law enforcement and the citizens. But the structural impact of the violent episode will be long-lasting. Two camps will emergethose who participated and supported the uprising, and those who will remain loyal to the past regime. Such a schism can fuel risks of group-targeted violence. Do you see any scenarios in which civilians could face large-scale, targeted attacks in the near future? Which scenarios do you think may be most likely or most concerning? Ahead of the downfall of the regime in August 2024, Bangladesh had experienced the most brutal crackdown and widespread violence since the countrys independence in 1971. The ferocity and rapidity of the spread of violence was unimaginable even though Bangladesh has experienced past bouts of political violence. The way the state apparatuses were used against unarmed civilian protesters between July 16 and August 5, it seemed like a war between the state and its people. After the downfall of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the violence took a different shape as police, AL supporters and some members of minority communities faced the fury of angry people. The absence of police on the street and mayhem provided opportunities to settle personal scores as well. But there also seem to have been coordinated attempts by the AL activists to unleash violence to create panic and destabilize the situation. These could be precursors of large-scale violence against civilians in the coming weeks and months. Desperate AL supporters, encouraged by their leaders within and outside the country, may try to demonstrate that the party is not a spent force. The most worrying scenario is that sporadic incidents of violence continue over months and devolve into conflicts between state security forces and AL activists. I am also afraid that members of the Hindu community may be attacked, which in addition to the direct harm to victims can be spun by political opportunists as examples of the rise of anti-Hindu Islamist forces and the failure of the interim government to provide safety. Approximately one million Rohingya refugees from Burma have sought safety in Bangladesh. Would you expect any changes regarding insecurity or risks facing Rohingya refugees as a result of the political turmoil in Dhaka? The political upheaval, prevailing uncertainties, and change in the government are unlikely to have any near-term impact on the Rohingya refugees. Two factors will shield the Rohingya refugees from being embroiled in the political situation. First, the interim governments approach towards the Rohingya refugees will be similar to that of the previous government. Professor Yunus has promised to continue support to Rohingya refugees. Second, international organizations such as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization of Migration (IOM), can continue providing services and will not become involved in domestic politics. In recent months, violence in the camps has increased due to turf wars between various groups (namely the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army and the Rohingya Solidarity Organization) and the volatile situation across the border. These developments are not connected to the political situation in Bangladesh. However, one unfortunate impact is that political changes will shift the focus away from the plight of the Rohingya, who require long-term support after the coup in Burma in 2021 and as the ongoing conflict in Arakan State makes repatriation elusive. What should policymakers and scholars watch for in the coming weeks and months? For the past 15 years, law enforcement agencies have committed gross violations of human rights and enjoyed impunity. Those who were in commanding positions must be held accountable. Policymakers should closely watch whether the interim government succeeds in preventing any kind of reprisal while bringing perpetrators to justice. Structural changes in institutions are necessary to end the culture of impunity and establish rule of law. Policymakers and scholars should monitor whether such moves are taken, and where necessary, the international community needs to offer help. An important aspect that Bangladesh watchers should follow is how the supporters of the deposed Hasina regimeboth in Bangladesh and in India behave in the coming months. If they succeed in creating instability through violent activities, it may engender a cycle of reprisal, and the country may plunge into a low-intensity conflict, which in turn can pose serious risks to civilians.

{"doc_id":"e8614fec0b6fe029","title":"Bangladesh Is Well-Positioned to Build a New Political Area. Can It Seize the Moment? | Carnegie Endowment for International Peace","content":"The dramatic collapse of former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasinas government has created extraordinary churn and uncertainty at home, in the region, and geopolitically. A student-driven movement led to widespread demonstrations that triggered a crisis within the regime, most notably the militarys refusal to repress the protests. Hasina is now in India, and an interim government is in place in Dhaka, advised by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. External observers are watching developments carefully to understand what trajectory Bangladesh might take. The most important questions are domestic. The aftermath of political revolutions can go in numerous directions, from civil war to the consolidation of a new and broadly accepted political system, and everything in between. Hasinas regime was what political scientists refer to as competitive authoritarian: there were elections, but her Awami League political party used the state apparatus to undermine the opposition and tilt the playing field to its advantage. The sudden end of that configuration has thrown the entire political system into a state of flux. The interim government is pursuing reforms of key sectors of the state, including the electoral system, the police, and the constitution. The good news is that Bangladesh is better positioned for stability than many other post-regime change cases. A state structure is in place, even if hollowed out and in need of serious reform. The comparative lack of large-scale regional or ethnolinguistic cleavages avoids some of the sources of state failure and political polarization witnessed in other contexts (though violence in tribal areas is a worrying development). Labor mobilization, which has been a regular occurrence in recent months, is generally not a source of political breakdown in these cases. In comparative perspective, Bangladesh has solid ingredients for successfully building a new political arena. Nevertheless, there are serious dangers. The most immediate challenge is the breakdown in basic state functioning, especially law and order (as Yunus has acknowledged). Insecurity creates an opening for vigilantism and mob violence, and it undermines political stability and economic investment. The mobilization of anti-Hindu and anti-blasphemy sentiment is a particularly potent potential driver. A key question moving forward will be how political parties and state institutions will deal with the relationship between Islam and Bangladeshi nationalism. The biggest open question is what political reforms will look like, how and in what sequence they will be implemented, and when and in what manner new elections will be held. Historically, this kind of transition can collapse in two ways. Elite power struggles, including coups, autocratic seizures of power by civilian leaders, and interparty deadlock, can stall the creation of a democratic post-revolutionary government. This can lead to some form of autocracy or even state breakdown. Alternatively, bottom-up discontentranging from mass protests to political violencecan undermine post-revolutionary governments ability to construct functional new institutions by causing a crisis of legitimacy. These challenges can also become dangerously entangled: for instance, communal or street violence can provide a motivation (or pretext) for leaders to double down on authoritarianism in the name of public order. In the face of these dangers, Bangladeshs current configuration of political forces, with an interim, unelected government partnering with the army, will need to make clear political progress with transparent goals and timelines. It will also need to make decisions about how best to spur economic development. Bangladesh has been suffering economically since the onset of the pandemic, and a lack of economic opportunity was a key source of discontent with Hasinas government. The summers instability contributed to further challenges in attracting investment. While the sacrifices and success of the anti-Hasina movement have provided the interim government with initial legitimacy, the longer it holds office, the more it will need to show economic benefits and political progress. If evidence of forward movement is replaced with a sense of political stagnation, the government will face dissension from within and criticism from citizens about the appropriate timing and structure of elections, which political changes are democratically legitimate, and how political and economic power should be allocated. For instance, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)the Awami Leagues longtime rivalhas articulated a different timeline for elections than the Bangladesh Army (and the fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami), which could lead to conflict over the right time for elections. Similarly, the status of Hasinas Awami League in a future election and how to punish those responsible for rights abuses could become objects of debate and disagreement. The political leadership needs to be attentive to the ways that a transition to a new and effective democratic system could become bogged down. Furthermore, Bangladesh is enmeshed in a complicated foreign policy environment. India was dismayed by the collapse of Hasinas government, and many in India are deeply concerned about anti-Hindu violence and the prospect of greater Islamization of Bangladeshi state and society. They are also reminded of past Bangladeshi support for insurgents operating in remote pockets of northeastern India. On the other hand, many Bangladeshis view India as having been an unconditional supporter of the Hasina regime and its abuses and are in no mood to listen to Indian lectures about human rights and minority protection. Of late, India has been able to recover from foreign policy missteps that made it an attractive domestic political target in Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Maldives, but its deep association with Hasina (as well as her current, even if temporary, residence in India) makes it harder to quickly and credibly pivot. In turn, Bangladesh cannot afford to alienate India; its sheer size and proximity provide it with leverage that Bangladeshs ties to China and the West cannot fully offset. The interim government hopes to establish a stable new equilibrium in India-Bangladesh relations that does not privilege India as much as under Hasinas rule. Bangladesh will also need to deal with the escalating civil war in Myanmar and especially the extraordinary level of conflict in Myanmars Rakhine state, which borders Bangladesh. Refugee flows and the growing power of the Arakan Armyan ethnic armed group in Myanmar that now controls much of Rakhineboth will present political challenges that the interim government will need to navigate. Finally, broader geopolitical issues are at play. Disagreements between the United States and India over how to handle the Hasina governmentespecially in the run-up to Bangladeshs 2024 election and its aftermath revealed real differences in the countries strategic assessments. The United States sees the collapse of Hasinas rule as evidence that its diagnosis of the regimes underlying instability and growing reliance on repression was ultimately correct. Some in India, however, see the foreign hand of the United States in her fall. From Americas perspective, helping Yunus and the interim government rebuild democracy and keep China at bay is a key priority. Many in India view this approach either as providing a dangerously nave opening to Islamist influence or as a cunning strategy for limiting Indian influence in the region. These differences will not roll back U.S.-India strategic convergence, but they are a crucial reminder that the United States and India reside in different neighborhoods and have different interests and perceptions. Both the United States and India are concerned about Chinas influence in Bangladesh. Hasina had successfully balanced close ties to New Delhi with a strong relationship with Beijing, but China has nimbly adapted to regime change. For the United States, advancing good governance and functional democracy in Bangladesh, ideally under the rule of relatively secular and pro-Western political forces, is seen as the best way to contain Chinese influence. Yet it is important for Washington to recognize that Dhaka has shown little inclination to become part of Americas China containment strategy. As in Nepal and elsewhere in South Asia, the United States will be most effective at providing distinctive complements, not direct substitutes, to what China has to offer, while being realistic about Bangladeshs desire to maintain good ties with all major powers.

It didnt take me 26 hours to unlock him, but even still, Ive spent so much time investing in Naoe that Yasuke is effectively unplayable to me. I dread the story missions where Im forced to play him. This is a ninja game to me, not a samurai game. It doesnt help that you spend so much time with Naoe from the start. Once you get used to being a ninja crawling through bushes and lurking on rooftops, its really hard to go back to the more traditional Assassins Creed hero that is Yasuke. His style is exactly what I havent liked about the series since Assassins Creed 3. He can sneak around and climb walls, but hes built to brawl. The problem is that combat in Assassins Creed Shadows is pretty clunky. With Naoe, the point is to avoid directly clashing with enemies, and that works in the games favor. Ubisoft has wall-climbing and traversal mastered at this point, so castles turn into 3D puzzles when you play stealthily. When I prepare to clean out a base, I plan out my route based on whats in front of me: Bushes are checkpoints to stop and observe patrolling guards, dark rooms are possible escape locations, and rooftops are perches to pinpoint my targets. And all of this shifts based on the time of day and how visible Ill be while crawling around. Stealth in Assassins Creed Shadows is all about execution and adapting to whatever happens when you inevitably screw up. Its actually fun when things go wrong because you have to play to Naoes strengths as a tiny ninja who isnt equipped to take on multiple enemies swinging at her well, as long as youre not using the weapon that breaks the game. As soon as youre caught, everything in the environment can be your lifeline against a squad of samurai hunting for you. All of this nicely complements how beautifully rendered the world is. Assassins Creed Shadows is one of the best-looking games Ive ever played, and its not all for show. Naoe has to rely on the world itself to succeed. Theres nothing better than piercing your sword through shoji to assassinate an enemy and see sunlight pour into the room. Its a risk that can get you caught, but its also an impressive example of how the hyperrealistic graphics have a material effect on how you interact with the world. Yasuke is encouraged to ignore all of that to pulverize enemies head-on. It can be a nice break from tiptoeing around, but it flattens Assassins Creed Shadows into a mediocre action game. Melee combat is spammy and weightless and only seems to be a good way to save yourself some time clearing out a castle. It just isnt satisfying to me to ram my way through a series of enemies until I get to a treasure chest. Theres no real strategy to it because hes made to bull rush through every encounter. Naoe, however, is exactly what I like about stealth games. Im patient, but not so patient that I can endure slowly picking off every enemy on the way to my objective. So I simply dont, and push myself to keep moving and adapting to what happens on the fly. This adds a layer of tension that fighting as Yasuke lacks as you balance not getting caught while trying to squeeze your way straight toward your target. I like Yasuke as a character, and his friendship with Naoe is endearing, but I find the power fantasy of playing a tank rather empty in a game that is set up for a much slower, methodical approach. All I ever want to do is play the ninja revenge story that no other Assassins Creed has given me.","url":"https://www.polygon.com/gaming/560199/assassins-creed-shadows-solo-protagonist-naoe-yasuke/"}

Although blockchain has found many applications outside of cryptocurrency, many of its features are not well suited to common data management applications. The added trust of distributed ledgers is a valuable feature, providing greatly simplified auditability and verification of actions among multiple parties in applications such as supply chain and others, but there are tradeoffs. Blockchain's hash-based integrity verification provides trust, at the cost of an inability to delete or update records, leading to design complications that would not arise with conventional database management systems. Similarly, the sequencing guarantees of blockchain consensus protocols are needed for cryptocurrency in the absence of a universal timestamp. Moreover, actions within the distributed ledger must be connected with other actions in the real world, through accurate timestamps. We are developing a new architecture that provides the trust features of blockchains, with characteristics that allow for simpler designs and greater practicality in conventional data management problems. We believe this alternative can lead to new approaches to incorporating trust into distributed systems applications. Blockchain and Economic Development: Hype vs. Reality Center for Global Development - July 2017 Increasing attention is being paid to the potential of blockchain technology to address long-standing challenges related to economic development.

{"doc_id":"7cce5ea0691afd0f","title":"3 Ways in which Blockchain can Help Education Industry","content":"It is not long when Blockchain was a buzz word and every business out there was rushing to hire resources for Ethereum development (Ethereum being one of the most popular Blockchains). But with time, the people and industry have matured, and now businesses emphasis on getting comprehensive Blockchain consulting services first before deciding to invest in the solution development. Blockchain is a network of distributed ledgers, where information is stored in groups (known as Blocks) in the form of cryptographic hashes A cryptographic hash function can convert information of any size into a unique fixed length alphanumeric string. Two different information pieces can never have the same cryptographic hash. Even, if a small change is made in the information, it will lead to a different cryptographic hash. Different types of Blockchains group a specific number of hashes in the form of a block and each block has a reference to the previous and next block, thus forming an immutable chain of a group of hashes connected with each other. Problems in education industry and how Blockchain can solve them The education industry is not well connected, and the information is stored in silos. It relies heavily on information published in physical form. Thus, the information is prone to duplication and tempering. Some of the major challenges are: 1. Verification of certificates With so many advanced image editing software available, a paper-based degree or certificate can be easily reproduced or edited. Differentiating between a doctored/fake document and the original is almost impossible. Although most of the certificates/degrees have a unique identification number. Availability of the means to audit and verify this unique number is less or completely missing. Businesses hire third-party verification services provider to authenticate these certificates/degrees which cost considerably. The verification process itself is long and time-consuming resulting in unnecessary delays in the hiring process. Solution Educational institutes can opt for Ethereum development to build a network of institutes on Blockchain. This network can be joined by other corporate businesses that can have only the access rights. Every transaction in such a network gets recorded with a time stamp and the details of the transaction are stored in the form of a cryptographic hash that makes making changes in the recorded information almost impossible. Such a Blockchain-based network is write-once only and any new information can only be appended i.e. information cant be deleted or edited. Even the owner of the information can only append the information, and it is easy to track who made the changes and when. This network can be utilized to publish degrees/certificates digitally. All the information related to a persons profile can be recorded in the form of a smart contract a feature of Ethereum Blockchain. Educational Institutes can publish certificates/degrees on the network and the information can be added in the smart contract. Whenever a piece of new information (a new certificate or degree) gets added to the smart contract, the person needs to verify the information. After verification, it becomes a permanent history of the persons profile. Every member of the network including businesses will get automated alerts initiated by the smart contract for new additions or updates made in the persons profile. This streamlines the verification process, eliminating the need of the third party verification services. But in the real world scenario, the third party verification companies can themselves utilize such networks to provide better services. Proof of original work & authorship In higher studies, research work plays an important role. Postgraduate students and scholars often publish research work. Also, many of these researches are sponsored by corporate entities. To check whether the work is original or copied, universities and journals take services of online plagiarism tools which cost them thousands of dollars. Solution In a Blockchain network (as explained earlier), each research paper can be stored with a unique identifier. Also, the text file containing the research work can be fed into an algorithm known as SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm) which generates unique 256-bit hashes for added security. Thus, it is impossible to make copies of the information and only people with the right credential can access the information. Additionally, it is easy to prove the ownership of the work. Cross-border payments Many students cross borders for getting a better education. They face many hurdles while transferring money across borders for paying fees and other educational expenses. In international transfers, the transaction fees is high and there is no visibility as to when the receiver will get the funds. Solution By developing a cryptocurrency that can be exchanged for availing various educational services and for making fee payments, the education institutes can settle the payments faster. Moreover, this cryptocurrency can be utilized for rewarding the outstanding performing students automatically via smart contracts when they achieve certain goals, who can then utilize the received funds to make fee payments or avail other educational services. Conclusion Education Industry is ripe for Blockchain implementation. The benefits of implementing Blockchain outshines the cost involved in the development by a huge margin. However, to utilize this technology to the full potential, a technology partner who can provide comprehensive Blockchain consulting services is essential.

{"doc_id":"ab94e6866cb3c64f","title":"Dancing with Daffodils  – Farming Innovation Programme","content":"Unlocking environmental and economic benefits for the dairy sector through the use of novel additives from a scalable daffodil opportunity. The challenge Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ruminants represents a major challenge to the UK farming industry, with agriculture accounting for 12%1 of total GHG emissions and 49%2 of total UK methane emissions in 2022. With regulatory and industry pushes to reduce GHGs and methane output, solutions are therefore urgent. There are a number of different strategies to reduce methane emissions, including nutritional strategies, animal genetics, and whole-farm systematic approaches through improved stock productivity. Of the nutritional solutions, results can be inconsistent and have yet to tackle the associated issues such as improving the efficiency of protein utilisation. The answer in daffodils This innovative new project will research, test and develop a solution using a novel additive extracted from daffodils that could not only be capable of decreasing ruminant methane emissions, but also improve protein utilisation bringing environmental and economic benefits to the sector. Led by high-quality feed specialists Rumenco, with support from bioresearchers Agroceutical and a consortium of experts, growers and researchers, the project will work to identify the opportunity that exists to help tackle this huge GHG issue for UK dairy farmers. The consortium allows different unique skills to come together, including SRUCs ability to measure methane from individual cows, the development of a farm-based methane measurement device, daffodil producers and extraction specialists, and the UK Agri-Tech Centre to ensure knowledge exchange for the sector. Project scope This project started in June 2023 with a focus on the extraction and analysis of an alkaloid compound from daffodils. Preliminary work has shown this compound to potentially reduce rumen methane production along with improving feed protein usage efficiency. The key objectives are to develop a unique, innovative product that increases efficiency and sustainability of ruminant meat and milk, whilst also reducing the carbon footprint and protein-imports in the supply chain. This will involve preparing and testing the use of the additive in ruminant feed, including optimal dosage to maximise potential. The project will also identify and assess the opportunity for scaling of daffodil growth as a cash crop in the UK to meet the potential demand that could result from successful demonstration of the additive. As part of the work, the project will therefore consider the potential for a local, sustainable and resilient daffodil growing sector across the UK. Its all part of creating a more efficient food system, explains Kevin Stephens, Founder and Director at Agroceutical: A significant proportion of agricultural land is not suitable for growing food crops and therefore we need to use ruminant livestock to convert the grass into something the increasing human population can consume. Changing the amount of food animals require and the volume of emissions they produce is a significant challenge, but one we really hope the daffodil can help tackle. As the project progresses, we are also keen to continue to develop the extraction and processing methods, to create a more efficient system that can be scaled up. Traditionally, these kinds of chemical processes have relied on throwing power at it to make it work, but we want to reinvent the scientific methods to work with nature more effectively to deliver the results we need. Since inception, the project has initially been focused on optimising extraction techniques and the analysis of the additives potential. With work completing on these tasks and initial results being reviewed, attention is now turning to the preparation stage for how the additive can be effectively introduced to ruminant food. Whats next? As the project progresses, work will focus on demonstrating the key benefits of the opportunity for a variety of stakeholders, including daffodil growers, ruminant farmers, feed manufacturers, and the dairy sector more widely. The partners aim to showcase real-world data around the additives effectiveness on protein utilisation, whilst also targeting the wider problem of the environmental impact of dairy farming, through the reduction in methane production. Achieving these results will then aid communication and engagement efforts that will be key to the wider uptake and commercialisation plans of the project partners. As Alison Bond, Technical Services Manager at Rumenco, explains, this is part of the aim to put the UK in a leading global position: The UK benefits from the perfect climate for daffodil growth, and faces limited international competition from countries with the same conditions. Success in this project will be a valuable step towards creating an international market and supply chain for these additives and food products. With governments seemingly destined to incentivise and support low-methane farming systems due to environmental pressures, the benefits of a UK-led solution will be substantial. The funding has been vital in giving us the platform to take the concept forward and back our efforts to bring novel science into the food sector. Furthermore, having access to a wider group of experts in Defra and Innovate UK not only helps keep the project on track with our aims, but also supports other areas of networking and regulatory guidance as we progress. 1 and 2: UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions National Statistics 1990 to 2022.","url":"https://farminginnovation.ukri.org/case-studies/dancing-with-daffodils/"}

Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency that was famed for its computer encryption, preventing many from making fraudulent transactions online. Considering the benefits that cryptocurrencies could offer to the fintech industry, new cryptocurrencies are launched, often than before. And the result is that there are over 1000 cryptocurrencies available, while many are still in the progress phase. The reason behind the popularity of digital currencies is their diverse use cases. Today, the applications of cryptocurrencies are not limited to just securing transactions or verifying transfer of assets. In fact, they are used by startups for raising funds, which was earlier restricted to Initial Public Offering (IPO), venture capital, or angel investment (along with their respective constraints). Cryptocurrencies are used as a token for launching Blockchain based Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The possibility of getting high returns on investing in cryptocurrency market has resulted in huge interest of investors. Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S. had a rise in number of users from 0.4 million (in Jan 2017) to 4.3 million (in Dec 2017).

{"doc_id":"c33091626406922a","title":"Nipocalimab, the first and only investigational treatment to be granted U.S. FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe Sjögren’s disease, has now received Fast Track designation","content":"SPRING HOUSE, Pa., (March 18, 2025) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted investigational nipocalimab Fast Track designation (FTD) for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe Sjgrens disease (SjD), having previously been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation (BTD) for the investigational therapy late last year. Currently, no advanced therapies are approved to treat this disease. Building upon the BTD, which nipocalimab is the first and only therapeutic to receive for SjD, the U.S. FDAs FTD is also designed to accelerate the delivery of new therapeutics to patients by facilitating the development and expediting the review of drugs that demonstrate the potential to treat serious conditions and help address unmet needs for serious or life-threatening conditions. This marks an additional important step forward in our efforts to bring meaningful advancements to people living with Sjgrens disease, a serious and debilitating condition. We look forward to continuing to work closely with the FDA to advance the clinical development of nipocalimab and potentially provide a much-needed treatment option for this community, said Katie Abouzahr, M.D., Vice President, Autoantibody Portfolio and Maternal Fetal Disease Area Leader, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. There are no FDA-approved treatments that directly address the underlying causes of this complex disease, associated with serious health consequences including chronic dryness of moisture producing glands that may lead to systemic complications such as joint pain, fatigue and inflammation in multiple organ systems.1,2,3 These systemic complications can lead to an increased risk of mortality and associated health conditions, including a 20 times greater risk of developing B-cell lymphomas when compared to the general population.1,4 The Phase 2 DAHLIAS study, the results of which were presented last year, represented the first-ever positive results of an investigational FcRn blocker as a potential targeted therapy in SjD. The study achieved the primary endpoint in the 15 mg/kg Q2W nipocalimab group, showing a greater than 70% relative average improvement in systemic disease activity at Week 24 compared to placebo and IgG reductions of more than 77%.5 Trends of improvement were similarly observed across multiple secondary endpoints.5 Safety and tolerability were consistent with other nipocalimab clinical studies.5 ABOUT SJGRENS DISEASE Sjgrens disease (SjD) is one of the most prevalent autoantibody-driven diseases for which no therapies are currently approved that treat the underlying and systemic nature of the disease.1 It is a chronic autoimmune disease that is estimated to impact approximately four million people worldwide and is nine times more common in women than men.6,7 SjD is characterized by autoantibody production, chronic inflammation, and lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands. Most patients are affected by mucosal dryness (eyes, mouth, vagina), joint pain and fatigue.1 More than 50% of SjD patients have a moderate to severe form of the condition, and disease burden can be as high as that of rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. It is usually associated with impaired quality of life and functional capacity.6.8,9 ABOUT DAHLIAS DAHLIAS (NCT04968912) is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind study to evaluate the effects of nipocalimab in participants with primary Sjgrens disease. DAHLIAS is a Phase 2 dose-ranging study for adults with moderately-to-severely active primary SjD who were seropositive for anti-Ro60 and/or anti-Ro52 IgG antibodies. 163 adults aged 18-75 were randomized 1:1:1 to receive intravenous nipocalimab at 5 or 15 mg/kg or placebo every 2 weeks through Week 22 and received protocol-permitted background standard of care. Safety assessments were conducted through Week 30. The primary endpoint was change in baseline in the ClinESSDAI (Clinical European League Against Rheumatism Sjgrens Syndrome Disease Activity Index) Score at Week 24. ClinESSDAI is a systemic diseases activity index designed to measure disease activity in patients with primary SjD based on 11 domains including: constitutional, lymphadenopathy, glandular, articular, cutaneous, respiratory, renal, muscular, peripheral nervous system, central nervous system, and hematological. ABOUT NIPOCALIMAB Nipocalimab is an investigational monoclonal antibody, designed to bind with high affinity to block FcRn and reduce levels of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies potentially without impact on other immune functions. This includes autoantibodies and alloantibodies that underlie multiple conditions across three key segments in the autoantibody space including Rare Autoantibody diseases, Maternal Fetal diseases mediated by maternal alloantibodies and Rheumatic diseases.5,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.17 Blockade of IgG binding to FcRn in the placenta is also believed to limit transplacental transfer of maternal alloantibodies to the fetus.18,19 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have granted several key designations to nipocalimab including: - U.S. FDA Fast Track designation in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) in July 2019, gMG in December 2021 and fetal neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) in March 2024 and Sjgrens disease (SjD) in March 2025 - U.S. FDA Orphan drug status for wAIHA in December 2019, HDFN in June 2020, gMG in February 2021, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) in October 2021 and FNAIT in December 2023 - U.S. FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation for HDFN in February 2024 and for Sjgrens disease in November 2024 - U.S. FDA granted Priority Review in gMG in Q4 2024 - EU EMA Orphan medicinal product designation for HDFN in October 2019 ABOUT JOHNSON & JOHNSON At Johnson & Johnson, we believe health is everything.

{"doc_id":"ef3b0a22a611e9d8","title":"Inside HGG Advances: A Chat with Daffodil Canson - ASHG","content":"Posted By: HGG Advances Each month, the editors of Human Genetics and Genomics Advances interview an early-career researcher who has published work in the journal. This month we check in with Daffodil Canson () to discuss her paper Splicing annotation of endometrial cancer GWAS risk loci reveals potentially causal variants and supports a role for NF1 and SKAP1 as susceptibility genes. HGGA: What motivated you to start working on this project? DC: I have a long-standing interest in studying variant effects on gene expression and protein function and in unravelling the molecular mechanisms of disease-associated variants. As part of my PhD project, I developed the SpliceAI-10k calculator, a SpliceAI-based splicing prediction tool that facilitates identification of variants that alter splicing motifs leading to aberrant or alternative splicing. This tool performed well on the training dataset of high-risk variants in Mendelian disease genes. The next logical step was to try out the tool with other variant datasets. Candidate causal variants from the largest endometrial cancer GWAS risk meta-analysis offered a great starting point for expanding the application of the SpliceAI-10k calculator, as there was no prior splicing analysis conducted using this dataset. Integrating the splicing predictions with large-scale annotations of alternative transcript isoforms and tissue sQTLs then identified potentially causal variants that may mediate their effects on endometrial cancer risk through alternative splicing. HGGA: What about this paper/project most excites you? DC: I enjoyed the process of looking for supporting evidence for my splicing predictions, which eventually led to the creation of a splicing annotation workflow for GWAS risk variants. The most exciting part was the discovery of annotated alternative transcript isoforms and sQTL data that supported the splicing predictions. It is very rewarding to see ones tool working as intended. HGGA: What do you hope is the impact of this work for the human genetics community? DC: I hope that the splicing annotation workflow presented in our paper will also be useful in the interpretation of other GWAS datasets. The workflow can facilitate the prioritization of candidate causal variants for functional follow-up studies and aid the discovery of target genes. HGGA: What are some of the biggest challenges youve faced as a young scientist? DC: Keeping up with the latest bioinformatic tools, molecular methods, and large-scale genetic annotations is my biggest challenge; keeping my sanity in this rapidly advancing research field is a close second. As a young scientist, it is important to avoid becoming too overwhelmed with the amount of data to be handled and with the difficulty of solving research problems, especially when exploring uncharted territory. The ability to withstand frustrations and failures is essential. I am grateful to be working in a supportive and collaborative environment that helps me face these challenges. HGGA: And for fun, what is one of the most fascinating things in genetics youve learned about in the past year or so? DC: It is fascinating to see the growing role of artificial intelligence in the development of clinical variant interpretation models and the use of such models in guiding patient diagnosis and management.","url":"https://www.ashg.org/hgga/inside-hgg-advances-with-daffodil-canson/"}

{"doc_id":"0e16a46700d8b0e0","title":"How the daffodil got its trumpet | University of Oxford","content":"How the daffodil got its trumpet The daffodil is one of the few plants with a 'corona', a crown-like structure also referred to as the 'trumpet'. New research suggests that the corona is not an extension of the petals as previously thought, but is a distinct organ sharing more genetic identity with stamens, the pollen-producing reproductive organs. The origin of the corona has long been a subject of debate in botany, and in the 1930s botanist Agnes Arber claimed that it was an extension from the petals. With its colourful petal-like appearance, it's easy to see why this was believed for so long. Yet by studying the corona's development and genetic information, this new study has shown that it is in fact related to stamens. Dr Robert Scotland of the University of Oxford led the research, and was supported by colleagues at Harvard University, the United States Department of Agriculture and the University of Western Australia. The researchers were funded by the Gatsby Charitable Foundation and the United States National Science Foundation. The study is published online in The Plant Journal. By studying the development of daffodil flowers, the researchers found that the corona only begins to form after the other parts of the flower are fully established. 'This shows that the corona could not be a straightforward modification of either petals or stamens,' explains Dr Scotland. 'Since it develops independently of both, it is more accurately described as a separate organ.' The different parts of daffodil flowers are located on a small cup-like platform termed the 'hypanthium'. The researchers analysed genetic activity in all parts of the daffodil flower, and found that daffodil coronas were genetically similar to the stamens and hypanthium, but not the petals. 'We found that the corona develops from the hypanthium, and is not simply en extension of the petals or stamens,' says Dr Scotland. 'The corona is an independent organ, sharing more genetic identity with stamens, and which develops after the other organs are fully established.'.","url":"https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2013-02-19-how-daffodil-got-its-trumpet"}
{"doc_id":"64ede511c6f95893","title":"Daffodils Bloom To Aid Cancer Research — Harvard Gazette","content":"Daffodils Bloom To Aid Cancer Research While other funding sources balked, the American Cancer Society decades ago funded Andrus Professor of Pediatric Surgery Judah Folkmans research into ways to cut off the blood supply to cancerous tumors. Today, Folkmans research and the anti-angiogenesis drugs it has spawned is being hailed as a new hope in fighting cancer. And the American Cancer Society is still raising money for research, sometimes gambling on research that others might not back. The Cancer Society honored Harvard University Monday for being the largest single contributor in Massachusetts during last years Daffodil Days fundraiser, one of the societys three largest fundraisers annually. Harvards involvement with Daffodil Days started in 1988, when Rita Corkery, former associate director of community relations in the Office of Government, Community and Public Affairs and a cancer survivor, coordinated Harvards first effort, which raised $2,500. Last year, Harvard staff, students, and faculty bought nearly 6,000 bouquets of daffodils, raising $28,000 for the Cancer Society. Carole Lee, department administrator for the Office of Government, Community and Public Affairs, and the current coordinator of the Universitys Daffodil Day campaign, accepted the award for the University at a luncheon to kick off this years Daffodil Days at the Boston Harbor Hotel in Boston. Lee thanked those who help with the program, including the Departmental coordinators 99 of them who do the legwork in getting the word out to colleagues about the fundraising program. After the luncheon, Lee said the Daffodil Days program draws universal support because cancer is so common in society. Theres not one of us whos not been touched by cancer, Lee said. Helene Palmer, the Cancer Societys regional executive for development in Cambridge, said she has just begun fundraising in Cambridge, and is both encouraged and a bit daunted by Harvards enthusiasm. Im lucky, but a bit overwhelmed to be inheriting Harvard because its a magnificent effort, Palmer said. It just takes a very special breed of volunteer and people with a special heart. Lee said many people were essential to Harvards effort last year, which she said raised about $4,000 more than the previous years $24,000. Among the driving forces of Harvards Daffodil Days campaign, Lee said, are the coordinators for the Harvard entities that were the top bouquet-sellers last year, namely Maureen Leary and Kay Lawless at Harvard Law School, Peter Conlin at the University Development Office, and Donna McLean and Jennifer Moltin at the School of Public Health. Lee also thanked Ursula Moore, manager of Harvard University Mail Services, who has taken over the distribution of the flowers, much to Lees relief. Now, instead of Lee having to recruit volunteers to distribute 6,000 bunches of daffodils, University Mail Services workers deliver the flowers along with their regular mail deliveries. Each year for more than a decade, Daffodil Days coordinators have fanned out across the University and taken orders for bunches of 10 flowers. The bunches are being sold for $5 each. In addition to research, Daffodil Days funding goes to cancer detection programs, education, and patient services, such as transportation of cancer patients to treatments, one-on-one support for women with breast cancer, tobacco control education, and mammography outreach. Cancer Society officials say theyre hoping to raise $2.8 million this year in New England, up from last years $2.6 million. Daffodils are the first flower of spring, the American Cancer Society symbol of hope, hope that more lives will be saved from cancer, Don Gudaitis, CEO of the Societys New England division, said at the luncheon. You [Lee and other Daffodil Days coordinators] are making a difference when you read about progress in research, when you read about tobacco control in Massachusetts. Research into new cancer treatments has paid off over time. Five-year cancer survival rates have risen from about 41 percent in the 1980s to more than 60 percent in the 1990s. Thats clear progress over a very short period of time, Gudaitis said.","url":"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2000/02/daffodils-bloom-to-aid-cancer-research/"}

The DAFFODIL study was conducted in girls aged 2-4 years with RTT to examine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of trofinetide and to validate that the recommended dosage, according to body weight, achieved target exposure. Methods: DAFFODIL was a phase 2/3, open-label study of trofinetide consisting of two treatment periods (12 weeks [period A] and 21 months [period B]). Pharmacokinetic samples were collected at regular intervals during period A. Assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and exploratory efficacy (Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement [CGI-I], CGI-Severity, caregiver GI-I [CaGI-I], and overall quality of life rating of the Impact of Childhood Neurologic Disability Scale [ICND-QoL]). Optional caregiver exit interviews were also conducted. Findings: Fifteen participants were enrolled. Overall, the most common TEAEs were diarrhea (80.0%) and vomiting (53.3%), which were mild or moderate in severity. Steady-state exposure at clinical doses fell within the target exposure range. RTT symptoms improved throughout the study as measured by the CGI-I, CaGI-I, and change from baseline in the ICND-QoL. In caregiver interviews (n = 7), all caregivers reported they were \"very satisfied\" or \"satisfied\" with trofinetide benefits. Conclusions: Trofinetide has acceptable tolerability in girls 2-4 years of age with RTT and provides long-term efficacy. Weight-based dosage achieves target exposure in younger children. Funding: The study was supported by Acadia Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, CA). This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04988867).

{"doc_id":"a80595be7d3b9f97","title":"What Bangladesh has achieved in the year since its revolution - Atlantic Council","content":"What Bangladesh has achieved in the year since its revolution Although a year has passed since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to flee the country in the face of a mass uprising, the spirit of Bangladeshs July Revolution is still alive on the campus of Dhaka University. From the graffiti on the university walls to the eyewitness testimonials of students who helped overthrow her regime, a walk through the campus helps to put into context all that the country is still grappling with as it marks the one-year anniversary of Hasinas ouster. Most importantly, it underscores the insistence of those who led the uprising that the former regime not be allowed to return to power. On the one-year anniversary of Hasinas departure on August 5, Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus announced that elections would be held in early February 2026, putting an end to much of the uncertainty about the length of the interim governments tenure. Yunus also promulgated the July Declaration, enshrining the core principles that guided the July Revolution. The political parties also reached agreement on a July Charter laying out their shared commitment to reforms intended to prevent the rise of another authoritarian government. Taken together, the announcement of the election date and the agreements on the reform process have cleared the path for the return of electoral politics. The interim government has much to celebrate as it marks its one-year anniversary. From the chaos that immediately followed Hasinas departure, the interim government was able to restore the basic functioning of the state. This was no simple task given the degree to which the civil service and security forces had been politicized during the Awami Leagues fifteen years in power. Even more importantly, the interim governments economic team moved swiftly and decisively to head off an incipient collapse of the banking system, which had been looted by Hasinas cronies. To their credit, Bangladeshs international partners, including the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, worked closely with the interim government to shore up the countrys shaky financial system. The search for justice is complicated by the flight of many of the alleged perpetrators. Leveraging the international network of Yunus, a Nobel Laureate and economist, the interim government assembled a broad international coalition to support its efforts to promote reforms and prepare to hold free and fair elections. Bangladesh has worked to repair relations with its traditional partners, including the United States, which had been strained during Hasinas tenure. After months of engagement with the Trump administration, on July 31 the interim government secured a new framework agreement on trade with Washington, under which Bangladeshs exports to the United States would be subject to a competitive 20 percent tariff. At the same time, Bangladesh has also enjoyed cordial relations with China, with Yunus meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping in March. However, the interim governments relations with India have remained frosty, despite Yunuss meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in April. Perhaps the most difficult challenges the interim government has faced are ensuring accountability for the crimes committed during Hasinas tenure and providing the regimes victims with a degree of justice. These crimes are not limited to the horrors inflicted on protesters in July and August of 2024, which the United Nations has documented. They also include the many extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and other abuses that preceded the July uprising. The search for justice is complicated by the flight of many of the alleged perpetrators, who left the country in the chaos surrounding the regimes fall. Hasina and many of her key lieutenants have been granted refuge in India, where they are able to meet freely despite the charges against them. While Hasina remains in exile, the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), a Bangladeshi judicial institution established in 2009, has begun trials against her and others with command responsibility for her regimes actions during July and August 2024. Meanwhile, the interim government has memorialized these abuses by establishing a museum on the grounds of Hasinas former official residence in Dhaka. Many of the victims of the Hasina government continue to face material and psychological challenges, and resources to address these needs remain scarce. There are early efforts to establish a Truth and Healing Commission, which would seek to document the crimes committed during Hasinas regime and allow for restitution to assist victims and their families. Currently, there seems to be little appetite for reconciliation from either the victims or the perpetrators. The Awami League, the former ruling party under Hasina, remains banned pending the outcomes of the ICT trials, and the party will likely not be allowed to participate in the next elections. Human rights groups continue to raise concerns about Awami League members and supporters who are currently in custody, many of whom face charges that seemingly lack sufficient evidence to justify their detention. It will most likely fall to the next elected government to decide on the fate of these detainees as part of its wider approach to accountability, justice, and reconciliation. While it is the eighth most populous country in the world, Bangladesh does not receive the attention it deserves, with very few experts in the United States or elsewhere paying close attention to developments there. Consequently, it is easy for those who wish to spread misinformation or disinformation to influence the narrative about the country. This has certainly been the case over the past year, as a narrative has emerged that post-Hasina Bangladesh has unleashed a genocide against the minority Hindu community, opened the door to Islamist extremism, and sold the country off to China. None of this is accurate, and its important to set the record straight as the country moves toward new elections. Over Hasinas fifteen years in power, Bangladesh increasingly shut itself off from the rest of the world. It denied visas to journalists, academics, and researchers, and it severely restricted freedom of speech. Now that the country has opened its doors once again, it is time for the world to pay closer attention to Bangladesh as it works to bolster its economy, pursue justice and accountability for the crimes of the Hasina regime, and reestablish democratic governance.

{"doc_id":"900e769a88fd774d","title":"Time will tell: time-lapse technology and artificial intelligence to set time cut-offs indicating embryo incompetence - PubMed","content":"Time will tell: time-lapse technology and artificial intelligence to set time cut-offs indicating embryo incompetence - PMID: 39455054 - DOI: 10.1093/humrep/deae239 Time will tell: time-lapse technology and artificial intelligence to set time cut-offs indicating embryo incompetence Abstract Study question: Can more reliable time cut-offs of embryo developmental incompetence be generated by combining time-lapse technology (TLT), artificial intelligence, and preimplantation genetics screening for aneuploidy (PGT-A)? Summary answer: Embryo developmental incompetence can be better predicted by time cut-offs at multiple developmental stages and for different ranges of maternal age. What is known already: TLT is instrumental for the continual and undisturbed observation of embryo development. It has produced morphokinetic algorithms aimed at selecting embryos able to generate a viable pregnancy, however, such efforts have had limited success. Regardless, the potential of this technology for improving multiple aspects of the IVF process remains considerable. Specifically, TLT could be harnessed to discriminate developmentally incompetent embryos: i.e. those unable to develop to the blastocyst stage or affected by full-chromosome meiotic aneuploidies. If proven valuable, this application would prevent the non-productive use of such embryos, thereby improving laboratory and clinical efficiency and reducing patient stress and costs due to unnecessary embryo transfer and cryopreservation. Study design, size, duration: The training dataset involved embryos of PGT-A cycles cultured in Embryoscope with a single media (836 euploid and 1179 aneuploid blastocysts and 1874 arrested embryos; 2013-2020). Selection criteria were ejaculated sperm, own (not donated) fresh oocytes, trophectoderm biopsy and comprehensive-chromosome-testing to diagnose uniform aneuploidies. Out-of-sample (30% of training), internal (299 euploid and 490 aneuploid blastocysts and 680 arrested embryos; 2021-2022) and external (97 euploid, 110 aneuploid and 603 untested blastocysts and 514 arrested embryos, 2018 to early 2022) validations were conducted. Participants/materials, setting, methods: A training dataset (70%) was used to define thresholds. Several models were generated by fitting outcomes to each timing (tPNa-t8) and maternal age. ROC curves pinpointed in-sample classification values associated with 95%, 99% and 99.99% true-positive rate for predicting incompetence. These values were integrated with upper limits of maternal age ranges (<35, 35-37, 38-40, 41-42, and >42 years) in logit functions to identify time cut-offs, whose accuracy was tested on the validation datasets through confusion matrices. Main results and the role of chance: For developmental (in)competence, the best performing (i) tPNa cut-offs were 27.8 hpi (error-rate: 0/743), 32.6 hpi (error rate: 0/934), 26.8 hpi (error rate: 0/1178), 22.9 hpi (error-rate: 1/654, 0.1%) and 17.2 hpi (error rate: 4/423, 0.9%) in the <35, 35-37, 38-40, 41-42, and >42 years groups, respectively; (ii) tPNf cut-offs were 36.7 hpi (error rate: 0/738), 47.9 hpi (error rate: 0/921), 45.6 hpi (error rate: 1/1156, 0.1%), 44.1 hpi (error rate: 0/647) and 41.8 hpi (error rate: 0/417); (iii) t2 cut-offs were 50.9 hpi (error rate: 0/724), 49 hpi (error rate: 0/915), 47.1 hpi (error rate: 0/1146), 45.8 hpi (error rate: 0/636) and 43.9 hpi (error rate: 0/416); (iv) t4 cut-offs were 66.9 hpi (error rate: 0/683), 80.7 hpi (error rate: 0/836), 77.1 hpi (error rate: 0/1063), 74.7 hpi (error rate: 0/590) and 71.2 hpi (error rate: 0/389); and (v) t8 cut-offs were 118.1 hpi (error rate: 0/619), 110.6 hpi (error rate: 0/772), 140 hpi (error rate: 0/969), 135 hpi (error rate: 0/533) and 127.5 hpi (error rate: 0/355). tPNf and t2 showed a significant association with chromosomal (in)competence, also when adjusted for maternal age. Nevertheless, the relevant cut-offs were found to perform less well and were redundant compared with the blastocyst development cut-offs. Limitations, reasons for caution: Study limits are its retrospective design and the datasets being unbalanced towards advanced maternal age cases. The potential effects of abnormal cleavage patterns were not assessed. Larger sample sizes and external validations in other clinical settings are warranted. Wider implications of the findings: If confirmed by independent studies, this approach could significantly improve the efficiency of ART, by reducing the workload and patient impacts (extended culture and cleavage stage cryopreservation or transfer) associated with embryos that ultimately are developmentally incompetent and should not be considered for treatment. Pending validation, these data might be applied also in static embryo observation settings. Study funding/competing interest(s): This study was supported by the participating institutions.

A simple way to think about AI is as a series of nested or derivative concepts that have emerged over more than 70 years: Directly underneath AI, we have machine learning, which involves creating models by training an algorithm to make predictions or decisions based on data. It encompasses a broad range of techniques that enable computers to learn from and make inferences based on data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks. There are many types of machine learning techniques or algorithms, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, support vector machines (SVMs), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), clustering and more. Each of these approaches is suited to different kinds of problems and data. But one of the most popular types of machine learning algorithm is called a neural network (or artificial neural network). Neural networks are modeled after the human brain's structure and function. A neural network consists of interconnected layers of nodes (analogous to neurons) that work together to process and analyze complex data. Neural networks are well suited to tasks that involve identifying complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data. The simplest form of machine learning is called supervised learning, which involves the use of labeled data sets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. In supervised learning, humans pair each training example with an output label. The goal is for the model to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs in the training data, so it can predict the labels of new, unseen data. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks, called deep neural networks, that more closely simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain. Deep neural networks include an input layer, at least three but usually hundreds of hidden layers, and an output layer, unlike neural networks used in classic machine learning models, which usually have only one or two hidden layers. These multiple layers enable unsupervised learning: they can automate the extraction of features from large, unlabeled and unstructured data sets, and make their own predictions about what the data represents. Because deep learning doesnt require human intervention, it enables machine learning at a tremendous scale. It is well suited to natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and other tasks that involve the fast, accurate identification complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data. Some form of deep learning powers most of the artificial intelligence (AI) applications in our lives today. Deep learning also enables: Generative AI, sometimes called \"gen AI\", refers to deep learning models that can create complex original content such as long-form text, high-quality images, realistic video or audio and more in response to a users prompt or request. At a high level, generative models encode a simplified representation of their training data, and then draw from that representation to create new work thats similar, but not identical, to the original data. Generative models have been used for years in statistics to analyze numerical data. But over the last decade, they evolved to analyze and generate more complex data types. This evolution coincided with the emergence of three sophisticated deep learning model types: In general, generative AI operates in three phases: Generative AI begins with a \"foundation model\"; a deep learning model that serves as the basis for multiple different types of generative AI applications. The most common foundation models today are large language models (LLMs), created for text generation applications. But there are also foundation models for image, video, sound or music generation, and multimodal foundation models that support several kinds of content. To create a foundation model, practitioners train a deep learning algorithm on huge volumes of relevant raw, unstructured, unlabeled data, such as terabytes or petabytes of data text or images or video from the internet. The training yields a neural network of billions of parameters encoded representations of the entities, patterns and relationships in the data that can generate content autonomously in response to prompts. This is the foundation model. This training process is compute-intensive, time-consuming and expensive. It requires thousands of clustered graphics processing units (GPUs) and weeks of processing, all of which typically costs millions of dollars. Open source foundation model projects, such as Meta's Llama-2, enable gen AI developers to avoid this step and its costs. Next, the model must be tuned to a specific content generation task. This can be done in various ways, including: Developers and users regularly assess the outputs of their generative AI apps, and further tune the model even as often as once a week for greater accuracy or relevance. In contrast, the foundation model itself is updated much less frequently, perhaps every year or 18 months. Another option for improving a gen AI app's performance is retrieval augmented generation (RAG), a technique for extending the foundation model to use relevant sources outside of the training data to refine the parameters for greater accuracy or relevance. An AI agent is an autonomous AI program, it can perform tasks and accomplish goals on behalf of a user or another system without human intervention, by designing its own workflow and using available tools (other applications or services). Agentic AI is a system of multiple AI agents, the efforts of which are coordinated, or orchestrated, to accomplish a more complex task or a greater goal than any single agent in the system could accomplish. Unlike chatbots and other AI models which operate within predefined constraints and require human intervention, AI agents and agentic AI exhibit autonomy, goal-driven behavior and adaptability to changing circumstances. The terms agent and agentic refer to these models agency, or their capacity to act independently and purposefully. One way to think of agents is as a natural next step after generative AI. Gen AI models focus on creating content based on learned patterns; agents use that content to interact with each other and other tools to make decisions, solve problems and complete tasks. For example, a gen AI app might be able to tell you the best time to climb Mt. Everest given your work schedule, but an agent can tell you this, and then use an online travel service to book you the best flight and reserve a room in the most convenient hotel in Nepal. AI offers numerous benefits across various industries and applications. Some of the most commonly cited benefits include: AI can automate routine, repetitive and often tedious tasks including digital tasks such as data collection, entering and preprocessing, and physical tasks such as warehouse stock-picking and manufacturing processes. This automation frees to work on higher value, more creative work. Whether used for decision support or for fully automated decision-making, AI enables faster, more accurate predictions and reliable, data-driven decisions. Combined with automation, AI enables businesses to act on opportunities and respond to crises as they emerge, in real time and without human intervention. AI can reduce human errors in various ways, from guiding people through the proper steps of a process, to flagging potential errors before they occur, and fully automating processes without human intervention. This is especially important in industries such as healthcare where, for example, AI-guided surgical robotics enable consistent precision. Machine learning algorithms can continually improve their accuracy and further reduce errors as they're exposed to more data and \"learn\" from experience. AI is always on, available around the clock, and delivers consistent performance every time. Tools such as AI chatbots or virtual assistants can lighten staffing demands for customer service or support. In other applications such as materials processing or production lines, AI can help maintain consistent work quality and output levels when used to complete repetitive or tedious tasks. By automating dangerous work such as animal control, handling explosives, performing tasks in deep ocean water, high altitudes or in outer space, AI can eliminate the need to put human workers at risk of injury or worse. While they have yet to be perfected, self-driving cars and other vehicles offer the potential to reduce the risk of injury to passengers. The real-world applications of AI are many.","url":"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence"}
{"doc_id":"dcca33430451a62b","title":"What is AI (Artificial Intelligence)? Definition, Types, Examples & Use Cases","content":"What is AI (Artificial Intelligence)? Definition, Types, Examples & Use Cases What is AI? Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. It includes learning, reasoning, and self-correction. Examples of AI applications include expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, machine vision, and generative tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity. As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have scrambled to promote how their products and services incorporate it. Often, what they refer to as \"AI\" is a well-established technology such as machine learning. AI requires specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No single programming language is used exclusively in AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia are all popular languages among AI developers. How does AI work? In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing that data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. This article is part of What is enterprise AI? A complete guide for businesses For example, an AI chatbot that is fed examples of text can learn to generate lifelike exchanges with people, and an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples. Generative AI techniques, which have advanced rapidly over the past few years, can create realistic text, images, music and other media. Programming AI systems focuses on cognitive skills such as the following: - Learning. This aspect of AI programming involves acquiring data and creating rules, known as algorithms, to transform it into actionable information. These algorithms provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for completing specific tasks. This aspect involves choosing the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome. This aspect involves algorithms continuously learning and tuning themselves to provide the most accurate results possible. This aspect uses neural networks, rule-based systems, statistical methods and other AI techniques to generate new images, text, music, ideas and so on. Differences among AI, machine learning and deep learning The terms AI, machine learning and deep learning are often used interchangeably, especially in companies' marketing materials, but they have distinct meanings. In short, AI describes the broad concept of machines simulating human intelligence, while machine learning and deep learning are specific techniques within this field. The term AI, coined in the 1950s, encompasses an evolving and wide range of technologies that aim to simulate human intelligence, including machine learning and deep learning. Machine learning enables software to autonomously learn patterns and predict outcomes by using historical data as input. This approach became more effective with the availability of large training data sets. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, aims to mimic the brain's structure using layered neural networks. It underpins many major breakthroughs and recent advances in AI, including autonomous vehicles and ChatGPT. Why is AI important? AI is important for its potential to change how we live, work and play. It has been effectively used in business to automate tasks traditionally done by humans, including customer service, lead generation, fraud detection and quality control. In a number of areas, AI can perform tasks more efficiently and accurately than humans. It is especially useful for repetitive, detail-oriented tasks such as analyzing large numbers of legal documents to ensure relevant fields are properly filled in. AI's ability to process massive data sets gives enterprises insights into their operations they might not otherwise have noticed. The rapidly expanding array of generative AI tools is also becoming important in fields ranging from education to marketing to product design. Advances in AI techniques have not only helped fuel an explosion in efficiency, but also opened the door to entirely new business opportunities for some larger enterprises. Prior to the current wave of AI, for example, it would have been hard to imagine using computer software to connect riders to taxis on demand, yet Uber has become a Fortune 500 company by doing just that. AI has become central to many of today's largest and most successful companies, including Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Meta, which use AI to improve their operations and outpace competitors. At Alphabet subsidiary Google, for example, AI is central to its eponymous search engine, and self-driving car company Waymo began as an Alphabet division. The Google Brain research lab also invented the transformer architecture that underpins recent NLP breakthroughs such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. What are the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence? AI technologies, particularly deep learning models such as artificial neural networks, can process large amounts of data much faster and make predictions more accurately than humans can. While the huge volume of data created on a daily basis would bury a human researcher, AI applications using machine learning can take that data and quickly turn it into actionable information. A primary disadvantage of AI is that it is expensive to process the large amounts of data AI requires. As AI techniques are incorporated into more products and services, organizations must also be attuned to AI's potential to create biased and discriminatory systems, intentionally or inadvertently. Advantages of AI The following are some advantages of AI: - Excellence in detail-oriented jobs. AI is a good fit for tasks that involve identifying subtle patterns and relationships in data that might be overlooked by humans. For example, in oncology, AI systems have demonstrated high accuracy in detecting early-stage cancers, such as breast cancer and melanoma, by highlighting areas of concern for further evaluation by healthcare professionals. - Efficiency in data-heavy tasks. AI systems and automation tools dramatically reduce the time required for data processing. This is particularly useful in sectors like finance, insurance and healthcare that involve a great deal of routine data entry and analysis, as well as data-driven decision-making. For example, in banking and finance, predictive AI models can process vast volumes of data to forecast market trends and analyze investment risk. - Time savings and productivity gains. AI and robotics can not only automate operations but also improve safety and efficiency. In manufacturing, for example, AI-powered robots are increasingly used to perform hazardous or repetitive tasks as part of warehouse automation, thus reducing the risk to human workers and increasing overall productivity. - Consistency in results. Today's analytics tools use AI and machine learning to process extensive amounts of data in a uniform way, while retaining the ability to adapt to new information through continuous learning. For example, AI applications have delivered consistent and reliable outcomes in legal document review and language translation. - Customization and personalization. AI systems can enhance user experience by personalizing interactions and content delivery on digital platforms. On e-commerce platforms, for example, AI models analyze user behavior to recommend products suited to an individual's preferences, increasing customer satisfaction and engagement. - Round-the-clock availability. AI programs do not need to sleep or take breaks. For example, AI-powered virtual assistants can provide uninterrupted, 24/7 customer service even under high interaction volumes, improving response times and reducing costs. AI systems can scale to handle growing amounts of work and data. This makes AI well suited for scenarios where data volumes and workloads can grow exponentially, such as internet search and business analytics. - Accelerated research and development. AI can speed up the pace of R&D in fields such as pharmaceuticals and materials science. By rapidly simulating and analyzing many possible scenarios, AI models can help researchers discover new drugs, materials or compounds more quickly than traditional methods. - Sustainability and conservation. AI and machine learning are increasingly used to monitor environmental changes, predict future weather events and manage conservation efforts. Machine learning models can process satellite imagery and sensor data to track wildfire risk, pollution levels and endangered species populations, for example. - Process optimization. AI is used to streamline and automate complex processes across various industries. For example, AI models can identify inefficiencies and predict bottlenecks in manufacturing workflows, while in the energy sector, they can forecast electricity demand and allocate supply in real time. Disadvantages of AI The following are some disadvantages of AI: - High costs. Developing AI can be very expensive. Building an AI model requires a substantial upfront investment in infrastructure, computational resources and software to train the model and store its training data. After initial training, there are further ongoing costs associated with model inference and retraining. As a result, costs can rack up quickly, particularly for advanced, complex systems like generative AI applications; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated that training the company's GPT-4 model cost over $100 million. - Technical complexity. Developing, operating and troubleshooting AI systems -- especially in real-world production environments -- requires a great deal of technical know-how. In many cases, this knowledge differs from that needed to build non-AI software.","url":"https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence"}
{"doc_id":"eb7702af34b373c0","title":"What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? | Google Cloud","content":"Ever wonder how your phone can recognize your face, a streaming service knows exactly what movie youll love next, or how a car can drive itself? The answer is artificial intelligence (AI). Far from being science fiction, or limited to just the chatbots we know and enjoy, AI is part of our daily lives in countless ways. It's one of the most transformative technologies of our time, acting as the engine behind modern innovation. But what does \"Artificial Intelligence\" actually mean? Let's break AI down in a way that everyone can understand. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of technologies that empowers computers to learn, reason, and perform a variety of advanced tasks in ways that used to require human intelligence, such as understanding language, analyzing data, and even providing helpful suggestions. Its a transformational technology that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and societies and the world. It encompasses many different disciplines, including computer science, data analytics and statistics, hardware and software engineering, linguistics, neuroscience, and even philosophy and psychology. AI is about teaching computers to do the amazing things our own brains can do, from understanding the world around them to learning new things and even coming up with fresh ideas. For instance, AI is used in optical character recognition (OCR) to pull text and data from various images and documents. This process transforms unstructured content into structured, business-ready data, helping uncover valuable insights. Artificial intelligence techniques, though diverse, all fundamentally rely on data, algorithms, and computational power. AI systems learn and improve through exposure to vast amounts of data, identifying patterns and relationships that humans might miss. This data serves as the training material, the quality and quantity of which are crucial for the AI's performance. As mentioned earlier, AI isn't a single technology but a broad field encompassing several key areas: Want to learn how to get started with AI? Take the free beginner's introduction to generative AI. Artificial intelligence can be organized in several ways, depending on stages of development or actions being performed. This classification defines AI models based on their intelligence level and problem-solving abilities. This classification categorizes AI based on how it operates and interacts in specific contexts. Let's clear up some common misconceptions about AI. Reality: AI systems can process and even simulate emotions, but they do not possess consciousness, self-awareness, or genuine feelings. They are complex pattern-matching machines. Reality: AI is only as good as the data it's trained on. If the data reflects human biases, the AI will learn and perpetuate them. Reality: While AI will certainly automate many tasks, it's more likely to augment human capabilities, freeing us up for more creative, strategic, and empathetic work. Automation AI can help automate workflows and processes or work independently from a team of workers. For example, AI can help automate aspects of cybersecurity by continuously monitoring and analyzing network traffic. Similarly, a smart factory may have many different kinds of AI in use, such as robots using computer vision to navigate the factory floor or to inspect products for defects, create digital twins, or use real-time analytics to measure efficiency and output. Reduce human error AI can minimize manual errors in data processing, analytics, assembly in manufacturing, and other tasks through automation and algorithms that follow the same processes every single time. Eliminate repetitive tasks AI can be used to perform repetitive tasks, freeing up people to work on more complex problems. Whether it's analyzing data, verifying documents, transcribing phone calls, moderating content, or answering straightforward customer questions such as \"Where are you located?\" AI excels at automating these repetitive or tedious job functions. Fast and accurate AI can process more information more quickly than a person, finding patterns and discovering relationships in data that someone might miss. Infinite availability AI isn't limited by time of day, the need for breaks, or other human needs. When running in the cloud, AI and machine learning can be \"always on,\" continuously working on their assigned tasks. Accelerated research and development The ability to analyze vast amounts of data quickly can lead to accelerated breakthroughs in research and development. For instance, AI can help with predictive modeling for potential new pharmaceutical treatments or with quantifying the human genome. AI's influence is vast and growing, touching nearly every aspect of our lives and industries. Heres where you can see it making a difference: Want to see more use cases for AI? Find 1,000+ real-world gen AI use cases over at the Google Cloud Blog. The idea of machines that can think for themselves isn't new. Concepts of artificial beings with intelligence stretch back decades, however, the modern field of AI truly began to take shape in the mid-20th century. Lets take a look at the history of AI as we know it: In recent years, two of the most exciting advancements in AI have been generative AI and large language models (LLMs). However, the frontier is rapidly expanding with the emergence of AI agents and agentic AI, which represent a significant step towards more autonomous and capable AI systems. For software developers, this may be particularly interesting because AI agents can be programmed to interact with software development tools, APIs, and even existing codebases. This opens up possibilities for AI to assist in more complex development tasks, such as automatically testing new features, refactoring large sections of code, or even managing project workflows. The ongoing research is focused on making these agents more reliable, efficient, and safe as they gain more autonomy.

Definition, Uses, and Types | Coursera","content":"Learn what artificial intelligence actually is, how its used today, and what it may do in the future. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems capable of performing complex tasks that historically only humans could do, such as reasoning, making decisions, or solving problems. At a glance, here's what you need to know about artificial intelligence: Today, the term AI describes a wide range of technologies that power many of the services and goods we use every day from apps that recommend TV shows to chatbots that provide customer support in real time. Machine learning is the most common form of artificial intelligence used today. As AI becomes more interwoven into our modern world, knowing how it works and how to use it can help you better leverage the technology at work and in your personal life. In this article, youll about artificial intelligence, what it actually does, and the different types. Youll also learn about some of its benefits and dangers and explore flexible courses that can help you expand your knowledge of AI even further. If you're ready to start building your AI skills, consider enrolling in the IBM AI Foundations for Everyone Specialization, where you'll gain a firm understanding of what AI is, its applications, and use cases across various industries. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the theory and development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that historically required human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and identifying patterns. AI is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of technologies, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP). Although the term is commonly used to describe a range of different technologies in use today, many disagree on whether these actually constitute artificial intelligence. Instead, some argue that much of the technology used in the real world today actually constitutes highly advanced machine learning that is simply a first step towards true artificial intelligence, or general artificial intelligence (GAI). Despite the many philosophical disagreements over whether true intelligent machines actually exist, when most people use the term AI today, theyre referring to a suite of machine learning-powered technologies, such as Chat GPT or computer vision, that enable machines to perform tasks that previously only humans can do like generating written content, steering a car, or analyzing data. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) refers to a theoretical state in which computer systems will be able to achieve or exceed human intelligence. In other words, AGI is true artificial intelligence, as depicted in countless science fiction novels, television shows, movies, and comics. Regardless of how far we are from achieving AGI, you can assume that when someone uses the term artificial general intelligence, theyre referring to the kind of sentient computer programs and machines that are commonly found in popular science fiction. : What Is Artificial General Intelligence? Definition and Examples Though the humanoid robots often associated with AI (think Star Trek: The Next Generations Data or Terminators T-800) dont exist yet, youve likely interacted with machine learning-powered services or devices many times before. At the simplest level, machine learning uses algorithms trained on data sets to create machine learning models that allow computer systems to perform tasks like making song recommendations, identifying the fastest way to travel to a destination, or translating text from one language to another. Some of the most common examples of AI in use today include: ChatGPT: Uses large language models (LLMs) to generate text in response to questions or comments posed to it. Google Translate: Uses deep learning algorithms to translate text from one language to another. Netflix: Uses machine learning algorithms to create personalized recommendation engines for users based on their previous viewing history. Apple's Siri: Apple's voice-activated personal assistant, Siri, is powered by deep neural networks (DNNs) to interact with users and complete their requests. AI stands for \"artificial intelligence.\" Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, such as computer systems. AI powers many technology-driven industries, such as health care, finance, transportation, and much more. : What Does AI Stand For? Artificial intelligence is prevalent across many industries. Automating tasks that don't require human intervention saves money and time, and can reduce the risk of human error. Here are a couple of ways AI could be employed in different industries: Finance industry. Fraud detection is a notable use case for AI in the finance industry. AI's capability to analyze large amounts of data enables it to detect anomalies or patterns that signal fraudulent behavior. AI-powered robotics could support surgeries close to highly delicate organs or tissue to mitigate blood loss or risk of infection. Enroll in AI for Everyone, an online program offered by DeepLearning.AI. In just 6 hours, you'll gain foundational knowledge about AI terminology, strategy, and the workflow of machine learning projects. Your first week is free. When researching artificial intelligence, you might have come across the terms strong and weak AI. Though these terms might seem confusing, you likely already have a sense of what they mean. Strong AI is essentially AI that is capable of human-level, general intelligence. In other words, its just another way to say artificial general intelligence. Weak AI, meanwhile, refers to the narrow use of widely available AI technology, like machine learning or deep learning, to perform very specific tasks, such as playing chess, recommending songs, or steering cars. Also known as Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), weak AI is essentially the kind of AI we use daily. : Machine Learning vs. AI: Differences, Uses, and Benefits As researchers attempt to build more advanced forms of artificial intelligence, they must also begin to formulate more nuanced understandings of what intelligence or even consciousness precisely mean. In their attempt to clarify these concepts, researchers have outlined four types of artificial intelligence. Heres a summary of each AI type, according to Professor Arend Hintze of the University of Michigan [1]: Reactive machines: Reactive machines dont possess any knowledge of previous events, but instead only react to what is before them in a given moment. As a result, they can only perform specific tasks within a very narrow scope, such as playing chess, and are incapable of performing tasks outside of their limited context. Limited memory machines: Limited memory machines possess a limited understanding of past events. They can interact more with the world around them than reactive machines can, but cannot form a complete understanding of the world. For example, self-driving cars use a form of limited memory to make turns, observe approaching vehicles, and adjust their speed. Theory of mind machines: Machines that possess a theory of mind are able to create representations of the world and possess an understanding of other entities that exist within the world. Right now, these machines are only theoretical. Self-aware machines: Machines with self-awareness are the theoretically most advanced kind of AI and would possess an understanding of the world, others, and themselves. This is what most people mean when they talk about \"true AI.\" Currently, this is a far-off reality. Generative AI is a kind of artificial intelligence capable of producing original content, such as written text or images, in response to user inputs or \"prompts.\" Generative models are also known as large language models (LLMs) because they're essentially complex, deep learning models trained on vast amounts of data that can be interacted with using normal human language rather than technical jargon. Generative AI is becoming increasingly common in everyday life, powering tools such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot. While other kinds of machine learning models are well suited for performing narrow, repetitive tasks, generative AI is capable of responding to user inputs with unique outputs that allow it to respond dynamically in real-time. This makes it particularly useful for powering interactive programs like virtual assistants, chatbots, and recommendation systems. That said, while generative AI may produce responses that make it seem like self-aware AI, the reality is that its responses are the result of statistical analysis rather than sentience. : Generative AI Examples and How the Technology Works AI has a range of applications with the potential to transform how we work and live. While many of these transformations are exciting, like self-driving cars, virtual assistants, or wearable devices in the healthcare industry, they also pose many challenges. Its a complicated picture that often summons competing images: a utopia for some, a dystopia for others. The reality is likely to be much more complex. Here are a few of the possible benefits and dangers AI may pose: Potential Benefits Potential Dangers ------ Greater accuracy for certain repeatable tasks, such as assembling vehicles or computers. Job loss due to increased automation. Decreased operational costs due to greater efficiency of machines. Potential for bias or discrimination as a result of the data set on which the AI is trained. Increased personalization within digital services and products. Possible cybersecurity concerns. Improved decision-making in certain situations. Lack of transparency over how decisions are arrived at, resulting in less than optimal solutions. Ability to quickly generate new content, such as text or images. Potential to create misinformation, as well as inadvertently violate laws and regulations.","url":"https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-artificial-intelligence"}

FAST-PACE utilizes a concise set of collected features to construct an artificial intelligence model that predicts the onset of cardiac arrest or acute respiratory failure from 1 h to 6 h prior to its occurrence. Data from the trajectory of 29,181 patients in intensive care units of two hospitals includes periodic vital signs, a history of treatment, current health status, and recent surgery. It excludes the results of laboratory data to construct a feasible application in wards, out-hospital emergency care, emergency transport, or other clinical situations where instant medical decisions are required with restricted patient data. These results are superior to previous warning scores including the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and the National Early Warning Score (NEWS). The primary outcome was the feasibility of an artificial intelligence (AI) model predicting adverse events 1 h to 6 h prior to occurrence without lab data; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of this model was 0.886 for cardiac arrest and 0.869 for respiratory failure 6 h before occurrence. The secondary outcome was the superior prediction performance to MEWS (net reclassification improvement of 0.507 for predicting cardiac arrest and 0.341 for predicting respiratory failure) and NEWS (net reclassification improvement of 0.412 for predicting cardiac arrest and 0.215 for predicting respiratory failure) 6 h before occurrence. This study suggests that AI consisting of simple vital signs and a brief interview could predict a cardiac arrest or acute respiratory failure 6 h earlier.

{"doc_id":"2ac350f58e363a3f","title":"Artificial Intelligence Defined in Simple Terms | HCLTech | HCLTech","content":"Artificial intelligence (AI) (including AI systems and AI technology) is a topic that has been discussed in philosophy and science fiction for decades but has rapidly become a reality. In 2017, AI became a household name. It was all over the news every day with companies like Google investing billions of dollars into developing more and more AI applications and other types of AI. AI technology covers some fascinating areas, from how we design intelligent machines to what our future might look like when these machines are more ubiquitous than humans. Examples include image recognition and when Siri tells you when it will rain in your city today. In this article, lets break down the basics of AI technology and AI systems so you can better understand what it means more simplistically. Topics covered in this article - What is artificial intelligence and what are some common types of AI? - What is machine learning and natural language processing (nlp)? - What is deep learning? What do people think of AI? When people are asked about AI, they usually think of Hollywood blockbusters like The Terminator. Its not surprising that someone who has never heard nor seen any mention about artificial intelligence before often conjures up images similar to movies such as The Terminator something which most might consider an accurate representation. They think we are at a point where AI applications can do all things for us take care of our jobs, make decisions without consulting with humans, and so forth. What is artificial intelligence? Artificial intelligence involves using computers and NLP to do things that traditionally require human intelligence. But what exactly is it? And why are we so excited about it? Artificial intelligence is the science of making machines that can think like humans. It can do things that are considered \"smart.\" AI technology can process large amounts of data sets in ways that are unlike humans. The goal for AI is to be able to do things such as recognize patterns, make decisions and judge like humans. To do this, we need lots of data and data sets incorporated into them. AI technology is at the very foundation of some things, such as image recognition and classification. It's also changing how we make decisions for example, it can be used to predict traffic light systems or when you get your coffee in the morning. What is machine learning? Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence and is a science of getting computers to learn and act as humans do through natural language processing. In traditional programming, a computer is given input data and an algorithm to produce an output. If a computer is given input data with the corresponding output data, it can learn the algorithm itself and, therefore, continue to predict the right output data. This is called supervised learning. Alternatively, if a computer is given a complex set of input data with no corresponding output data, the machine identifies the relationships in the data to provide valuable insights for decision-makers. This is called unsupervised learning. Why is machine learning such a big deal? Since the advent of machine learning, programming has become easier. Before machine learning became popular, programmers had to write out instructions for each program they wanted their computer to run. If there was a variable that wasn't outlined in these rules and conditions, then the code would stop working altogether- which is why we must use technologies such as machine learning. Machine learning allows us as developers to just give some basic suggestions on how certain things should be done and leave room open for more possibilities so our programs can learn from other data sets too! Driverless cars are a good example. People don't need to write out instructions for how to deal with every possible thing that could happen involving a pedestrian. Instead, they can teach the car not to hit pedestrians and provide it with millions of pictures of pedestrians walking near roads. This will help the car know what it needs to do when it \"sees\" something similar in the future. How has machine learning changed our lives? With machine learning, our computers can finally be more intelligent. It's not good by itself, so it needs other things to do that. For example, recommendations are powered by machine learning. This is true for recommendations on Google, Netflix, and Amazon. These same principles also apply to Facebook and Instagram ads. There are now genuinely viable alternatives for completing complex, time-consuming tasks with something other than a human. All business people should recognize this new development and take it into account in their day-to-day work. What is deep learning? Deep learning (DL) and natural language processing (nlp) can process, interpret, and make use of far larger and more complex data sets. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. As a result, deep learning can perform far more complex tasks. How is deep learning transforming us? Deep learning mimics the workings of our brains. Data is processed through multiple layers and eventually, with enough training data sets, these neural networks can outperform humans at intelligent tasks like speech recognition or playing chess. Machine learning has a simple if this, then that mechanism, whereas deep learning has if this, then that, then what about (x)? on repeat. In other words, machine learning can ask and answer one question, but it then requires human intervention. Deep learning will ask and answer one question and with its power of natural language processing, it will based on that answer ask another question, and answer it, and so on. Why does deep learning matter? Deep learning is the most advanced and sophisticated artificial intelligence technology. For example, it enables Google to give you a search result that's tailored specifically for your needs not just something they think everyone may want to know about. Deep learning goes one step further by enabling Google to tell you what other people are searching for as well. There are some great practical examples of how deep learning is helping us. In agriculture, deep learning helps to predict crop yield. Water levels and plant diseases can be detected so that farmers can respond in time. In insurance, deep learning helps to figure out the damage when cars get in traffic accidents. This is possible because deep learning can teach a computer how to identify damaged car parts, make predictions about how much it will cost for repairs, and make estimates about what will happen. In medicine, deep learning is changing the way doctors diagnose patients by finding what's important on medical scans, surveillance images, image recognition and other diagnostic tests. Deep learning has become more prominent in almost every industry, including financial services, retail, healthcare, utilities, Telcom and many others. The future with AI, ML, and DL When you think about artificial intelligence, many futuristic images come to mind. However, AI is quickly becoming a standard part of our everyday lives and businesses must learn. Machine learning is used by businesses in their everyday activities. So, they need to understand how machine learning works to take advantage of this powerful technology in their business operations. In the future, different types of AI, ML and DL will be able to do much more than what they can today. They will also have a bigger effect on our lives from social media to mobile phones, autonomous vehicles, wearable devices, home assistants, chatbots and so many others. What do you think of the different types of AI? Do you believe in artificial intelligence? Why or why not? How do you anticipate AI technology will change the way? We are now in the era of smart technology where we don't need to move or touch anything to complete a task. Everything can be done at the click of a button and with an elegant voice command. With more data becoming available, especially in the cloud, AI is going to become even smarter and able to do more things for us.","url":"https://www.hcltech.com/blogs/artificial-intelligence-defined-simple-terms"}

{"doc_id":"1c2660beaae5d61f","title":"Muhammad Yunus takes oath as head of Bangladesh’s interim government | Government News | Al Jazeera","content":"Muhammad Yunus takes oath as head of Bangladeshs interim government The Nobel Peace laureate says he will perform his duties sincerely as he is selected interim leader after Sheikh Hasinas resignation. The Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus has been sworn in as the head of Bangladeshs interim government, three days after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to resign and flee to neighbouring India. Yunus, 84, took the oath during a ceremony at the presidential palace in Dhaka on Thursday night that was attended by political leaders, civil society leaders, generals and diplomats. I will uphold, support and protect the constitution, Yunus said as he was administered the oath by President Mohammed Shahabuddin, adding that he will perform his duties sincerely. More than a dozen members of his cabinet, whose titles are advisers, not ministers, also took the oath as the caretaker government will now seek to restore peace and prepare for new elections. Recommended Stories list of 4 items- list 1 of 4Muhammad Yunus returns to Bangladesh to lead interim government - list 2 of 4Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel laureate, tasked to lead Bangladesh out of crisis - list 3 of 4Bangladesh economy under pressure amid uncharted political turmoil - list 4 of 4Sheikh Hasinas downfall and exile are of her own making They include Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, top leaders of the Students Against Discrimination group, which led the weeks-long protests that ousted Hasina. Others include Touhid Hossain, a former foreign secretary, and Hassan Ariff, a former attorney general. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, an award-winning environmental lawyer, and Asif Nazrul, a top law professor and writer, were also sworn in. Adilur Rahman Khan, a prominent human rights activist who was sentenced to two years in jail by Hasinas government, also took the oath as an adviser. No representatives of Hasinas Awami League party were present at the ceremony. Hasina quit on Monday after nationwide protests that began in July against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favoured people with connections to her party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a bigger challenge for Hasinas 15-year rule as more than 300 people, including students, were killed during spiralling violence. Yunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, was in the French capital for the 2024 Olympics when he was chosen for the interim role and returned home earlier on Thursday to tight security at the airport in Dhaka. In his first comments after his arrival, he said at a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it, Yunus said while flanked by student leaders. It has immense possibility. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his best wishes to Yunus, saying New Delhi was committed to working with neighbouring Dhaka. My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities, Modi wrote on the social media platform X. India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfil the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development. The United States also welcomed the new interim government in Bangladesh, saying it hoped to work together to advance democracy. We welcome Dr Yunuss call for an end to the recent violence and we stand ready to work with the interim government and Dr Yunus as it charts a democratic future for the people of Bangladesh, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters. He said that the highest-ranking US diplomat in Bangladesh, Helen LaFave, attended the inauguration ceremony and has been in touch with the interim government. The US had a largely cooperative relationship with Hasina over her 15 years in power that had grown tense as she bristled over US criticism on her record on democracy. Al Jazeeras Tanvir Chowdury, reporting from Dhaka, said Yunus wants the people to feel secure and has asked people not to seek vengeance or reprisal. Most people say it would be good if the interim government stays for a long time to clean up the system, he said. Chowdury said the people want an independent judiciary and election commission to depoliticise the system. Because whenever there is a political government, there are a lot of people who are loyal to that government and given a higher position, and that whole system gets corrupted, he said. On Wednesday, a tribunal in Dhaka acquitted Yunus in a labour law violation case involving a telecommunications company he founded in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He was out on bail in the case. Yunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a bloodsucker allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor people, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/8/muhammad-yunus-takes-oath-as-head-of-bangladeshs-interim-government"}

{"doc_id":"d308a5dc108c4896","title":"NaTHNaC - Bangladesh","content":"General Information The information on these pages should be used to research health risks and to inform the pre-travel consultation. Travellers should check the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) country-specific travel advice page (where available) which provides information on travel entry requirements in addition to safety and security advice. Travellers should ideally arrange an appointment with their health professional at least four to six weeks before travel. However, even if time is short, an appointment is still worthwhile. This appointment provides an opportunity to assess health risks taking into account a number of factors including destination, medical history, and planned activities. For those with pre-existing health problems, an earlier appointment is recommended. All travellers should ensure they have adequate travel health insurance. A list of useful resources including advice on how to reduce the risk of certain health problems is available below Resources Vaccine Recommendations Details of vaccination recommendations and requirements are provided below. All travellers Travellers should be up to date with routine vaccination courses and boosters as recommended in the UK. These vaccinations include for example measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and diphtheria-tetanus-polio vaccine. Country-specific diphtheria recommendations are not provided here. Diphtheria tetanus and polio are combined in a single vaccine in the UK. Therefore, when a tetanus booster is recommended for travellers, diphtheria vaccine is also given. Should there be an outbreak of diphtheria in a country, diphtheria vaccination guidance will be provided. Those who may be at increased risk of an infectious disease due to their work, lifestyle choice, or certain underlying health problems should be up to date with additional recommended vaccines. See details on the selective immunisation programmes and additional vaccines for individuals with underlying medical conditions at the bottom of the 'Complete routine immunisation schedule' document and the individual chapters of the 'Green Book' Immunisation against infectious disease for further details. Certificate requirements Please read the information below carefully, as certificate requirements may be relevant to certain travellers only. For travellers further details, if required, should be sought from their healthcare professional. - There is no risk of yellow fever in Bangladesh, however, there is a certificate requirement. - Under International Health Regulations, proof of vaccination against yellow fever is required from travellers aged 1 year or over arriving from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission and for travellers having transited through an airport of a country with risk of yellow fever transmission. - According to World Health Organization (WHO), from 11 July 2016 (for all countries), the yellow fever certificate will be valid for the duration of the life of the person vaccinated.

{"doc_id":"8d64f365a2915634","title":"New mobile app diagnoses crop diseases in the field and alerts rural farmers | Penn State University","content":"Researchers who developed a new mobile application that uses artificial intelligence to accurately diagnose crop diseases in the field have won a $100,000 award to help expand their project to help millions of small-scale farmers across Africa. Cassava brown streak disease is spreading westward across the African continent and, together with cassava mosaic disease, threatens the food and income security of more than 30 million farmers in East and Central Africa. Likewise, banana is threatened by fungal and bacterial diseases, including the devastating banana bunchy top virus, while late blight still plagues potato farmers. Farmers often are unable to identify these diseases properly, while researchers, plant-health authorities and extension organizations lack the data to support them. To stop the spread of these diseases, a team under the CGIAR Research Program on Roots, Tubers and Bananas (RTB) has developed a revolutionary app to accurately diagnose diseases in the field, which will be combined with SMS services to send alerts to thousands of rural farmers. CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) is a global research partnership dedicated to reducing poverty, enhancing food and nutrition security, and improving natural resources and ecosystem services. \"Smartphones are becoming more and more common in rural Africa,\" explained James Legg of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), who leads the project with David Hughes, associate professor of entomology and biology, Penn State. \"Smallholders or extension officers with a basic smartphone with a camera will be able to download the app for free, fire it up, point it at a leaf with disease symptoms and get an instant diagnosis. That is truly revolutionary!\" The app also will provide the latest management advice for all major diseases and pests of root, tuber and banana crops and will pinpoint the location of the nearest agricultural extension support for farmers. The team's $100,000 grant is part of the CGIAR Platform for Big Data in Agriculture \"Inspire Challenges\" program. The award was announced Sept. 21 at the Big Data in Agriculture Convention 2017 in Cali, Colombia. Although the app currently is developed for cassava, the grant will allow researchers to expand the tool for use with other root, tuber and banana crops that are critical sources of food, nutrition and income security for millions. \"This prize is transformative. It allows us to expand across multiple sites in Africa and multiple crops that are critical for food security on the continent,\" said Penn State's Hughes, who has appointments in the College of Agricultural Sciences and the Eberly College of Science. \"We can amplify by 100 times what we have achieved so far.\" Painstaking field work using cameras, spectrophotometers and drones at RTB cassava field sites in coastal Tanzania and on farms in western Kenya generated more than 200,000 images of diseased crops to train artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Using many of these images, Hughes, Legg and collaborators developed an AI algorithm that can automatically classify five cassava diseases, and by collaborating with Google, the team was able to develop the smartphone app with TensorFlow. It is currently being field-tested in Tanzania.","url":"https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/new-mobile-app-diagnoses-crop-diseases-field-and-alerts-rural-farmers"}
{"doc_id":"2767de5b7223aae2","title":"Pathogenesis and Disease Control in Crops: The Key to Global Food Security - PMC","content":"Plant diseases are a major threat to global food security. They can cause significant losses in crop yields, and can also lead to the spread of harmful toxins [1]. The pathogenesis of plant diseases is a complex process that involves the interplay between pathogens, hosts, and their environment [2,3]. The ever-evolving nature of pathogens and the effects of climate change on plant health make it essential to develop effective disease control strategies. A multi-pronged approach to disease control is imperative. Integrated pest management (IPM) strategies that incorporate cultural practices, biological controls, and targeted chemical interventions can help to minimize environmental impact while effectively tackling crop diseases [4]. Breeding disease-resistant cultivars through modern biotechnological tools is another avenue for curtailing pathogenesis and reducing reliance on chemical treatments [5]. Global collaboration is also essential for sharing insights, data, and successful strategies to help vulnerable regions fortify their defenses against emerging threats. Recent research plays a pivotal role in disseminating best practices among farmers, enabling them to make informed decisions and implement preventive measures [6,7]. By investing in research, technology, and international cooperation, humanity can cultivate resilience in agriculture and surmount the challenges posed by plant diseases [8,9]. This Special Issue of the journal Plants covers a range of topics related to the latest research trends in pathogenesis and disease control in crops for sustainable agriculture. The twelve original research articles and one review article in this Special Issue contribute to what we know about disease control in crops by providing new insights. These contributions shed light on the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis, the development of new disease control strategies, the use of biotechnology to improve disease resistance, and the impact of climate change on plant diseases. For example, Ibrahim et al. [10] revealed the potential of endophytic bacteria, and argued that the Pseudomonas poae strain CO can enhance wheat growth and can help to combat Fusarium seedling blight disease. The strains multifaceted antifungal properties and growth-promoting attributes make it a promising alternative to synthetic chemicals for safeguarding wheat against fungal infections. In another study, Kawaguchi et al. [11] developed a new pathogenhealthylatentlyinfectiousdiseased (PHLID) model for tomato bacterial canker (TBC) disease, offering insights into disease dynamics and control strategies. It successfully captured disease incidence and control effects, providing a valuable tool for simulating and managing TBC outbreaks. [12] developed integrative pathogenicity (IP) postulates for authenticated pathogenicity testing in plants. The IP postulates are based on the identification of effector genes associated with host pathogenicity, which are determinant markers for virulence. The IP postulates were validated by confirming the identity of a new forma specialis of Fusarium oxysporum that causes vascular wilt in datepalm. Some studies also reported the application of nanomaterials for plant disease management. For example, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in combination with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CFCS present a promising approach to help mitigate sweet potato soft rot disease, curbing pathogen growth while minimizing environmental nanoparticle contamination [13]. In another study, biogenically synthesized AgNPs from Arctium lappa fruit, Solanum melongena leaves, and Taraxacum mongolicum leaves hold promising antibacterial potential against rice bacterial leaf blight, showcasing the effective inhibition and disruption of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Similarly, Francesconi et al. [15] introduced an innovative nanostructured particle formulation (NPF) as an eco-sustainable solution for managing Fusarium head blight and Fusarium crown rot in compliance with the evolving environmental regulations, offering promising control and elicitor effects. Another study investigated the bacterial blight disease of cotton caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. The study found that the scratch method was the most effective for perpetuating Xcm in cotton varieties. The aqueous plant extracts of Aloe vera, Mentha piperita, Syzygium cumini, and Azadirachta indica showed the most promising antibacterial activity against Xcm pathogen [16]. In another study, Prez-Gonzlez et al. [17] found that wheat bran and amaranth are the best protein sources for stimulating the growth and conidiation of the entomopathogenic fungus Hirsutella citriformis. The gum produced by H. citriformis can be used to formulate conidia, which can improve the biological control of Diaphorina citri adults. [18] demonstrated that bayberry decline disease is associated with soil acidity and aluminum toxicity. The results suggest that mitigating the disease may be possible by regulating soil parameters, such as pH and aluminum concentration. On the other hand, a study found that tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) is a serious threat to tomato production in Saudi Arabia. The virus is highly virulent and can infect a wide range of tomato cultivars [19]. The review by Lv et al. [20] reported the beneficial and harmful effects of Pantoea bacteria on rice growth. The beneficial effects include growth promotion, abiotic alleviation, and disease inhibition, while the harmful effects include virulence and pathogenicity. The study also discussed the existing scientific problems and future research prospects in this field. In summary, the articles in this Special Issue are of interest to researchers, students, and other professionals working in the fields of plant pathology, crop science, and sustainable agriculture. They provide a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in learning more about the latest advances in disease control in crops.

{"doc_id":"b8bdfea9d846015d","title":"New comprehensive crop disease reference book edited by AgCenter scientists","content":"() BATON ROUGE A new crop disease reference guide co-edited by two LSU AgCenter-affiliated plant pathologists is designed to aid students, crop consultants and producers for decades to come. Diseases of Field Crops, a 400-page reference guide, details disease symptoms of 22 major field crops with more than 800 high-quality photographs. Boyd Padgett, an AgCenter plant pathologist, and Clayton A. Hollier, AgCenter professor emeritus, partnered with Martin A. Draper, associate dean for research and graduate programs in the Kansas State University College of Agriculture, to assemble the book. They worked with 49 authors to create the guide, which was published this spring by the American Phytopathological Society. We wanted to highlight the major diseases that were affecting each crop across the United States and even up into Canada, as well, Padgett said. Padgett, Hollier and Draper wanted to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date reference guide that would help readers identify and manage plant diseases. Our attempt was to update some existing field crop disease books that have been around for quite some time that are the standards, Padgett said. Padgett and Hollier co-authored the books first chapter on integrated plant disease management, which, according to the introductory paragraph, involves looking at every aspect of growing a crop and manipulating what can be done to reduce pathogens and their impact on the crop while minimizing negative effects on the environment and society. The other 22 chapters focus on individual crops and provide descriptions of diseases and the best management practices for combatting the diseases. While assembling the book and working with other experts in their field, the editors placed a priority on using detailed color photographs to illustrate each disease as it progresses. Plants exhibit different symptoms at different stages and in different environmental conditions, Padgett said. Just like in the human population, a kid who has a cold may exhibit different symptoms than someone who's 85 years old, and the older population may be more susceptible, he said. So, we wanted to be able to document and photograph the signs and the symptoms of each individual disease on these various field crops. Additional AgCenter-affiliated researchers contributed to the volume. Paul Trey Price, a plant pathologist at the AgCenter Macon Ridge Research Station, co-wrote the chapter on soybean diseases, and Donald E. Groth, the retired director of the AgCenter H. Rouse Caffey Rice Research Station, is an author of the chapter on rice diseases. Diseases of Field Crops, a reference guide for students, crop consultants and producers, is available through the American Phytopathological Society.

However, these crops are highly vulnerable to various leaf diseases, which pose significant threats to crop yields and food security if not promptly addressed. Consequently, there is an urgent need for an automated system that can accurately identify and categorize leaf diseases, enabling early intervention and management. This study explores the efficacy of the latest state-of-the-art object detection model, YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once), in surpassing previous models for the automated detection and categorization of leaf diseases in these five major crops. By leveraging modern computer vision techniques, the goal is to enhance the efficiency of disease detection and management. A dataset comprising 19 classes, each with 150 images, totaling 2850 images, was meticulously curated and annotated for training and evaluation. The YOLOv8 framework, known for its capability to detect multiple objects simultaneously, was employed to train a deep neural network. The system's performance was evaluated using standard metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP) and F1 score. The findings demonstrate that the YOLOv8 framework successfully identifies leaf diseases, achieving a high mAP of 98% and an F1 score of 97%. These results underscore the significant potential of this approach to enhance crop disease management, thereby improving food security and promoting agricultural sustainability in Bangladesh.

Methods: From 1 April 2007 through 31 March 2008, we used a low-cost surveillance strategy to identify new onset of respiratory symptoms in patients hospitalized for >72 h and in health care workers in medicine and pediatric wards at 3 public tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh. Results: During 46,273 patient-days of observation, we recorded 136 episodes of hospital-acquired respiratory disease, representing 1.7% of all patient hospital admissions; rates by ward ranged from 0.8 to 15.8 cases per 1000 patient-days at risk. We identified 22 clusters of respiratory disease, 3 of which included both patients and health care workers. Of 226 of heath care workers who worked on our surveillance wards, 61 (27%) experienced a respiratory illness during the study period. The cost of surveillance was US$43 per month per ward plus 30 min per day in data collection. Conclusions: Patients on these study wards frequently experienced hospital-acquired respiratory infections, including 1 in every 20 patients hospitalized for >72 h on 1 ward. The surveillance method was useful in calculating rates of hospital-acquired respiratory illness and could be used to enhance capacity to quickly detect outbreaks of respiratory disease in health care facilities where systems for outbreak detection are currently limited and to test interventions to reduce transmission of respiratory pathogens in resource-poor settings.

This study explored family caregivers' activities and their perceptions and practices related to disease transmission and prevention in public hospitals. Methods: Trained qualitative researchers conducted a total of 48 hours of observation in 3 public tertiary care hospitals and 12 in-depth interviews with family caregivers. Results: Family caregivers provided care 24 hours a day, including bedside nursing, cleaning care, and psychologic support. During observations, family members provided 2,065 episodes of care giving, 75% (1,544) of which involved close contact with patients. We observed family caregivers washing their hands with soap on only 4 occasions. The majority of respondents said diseases are transmitted through physical contact with surfaces and objects that have been contaminated with patient secretions and excretions, and avoiding contact with these contaminated objects would help prevent disease. Conclusion: Family caregivers are at risk for hospital-acquired infection from their repeated exposure to infectious agents combined with their inadequate hand hygiene and knowledge about disease transmission. Future research should explore potential strategies to improve family caregivers' knowledge about disease transmission and reduce family caregiver exposures, which may be accomplished by improving care provided by health care workers.

The sensitivity (93%), specificity (82%), positive predictive value (37%), and negative predictive value (99%) results suggested that screening questions could more quickly identify persons with Nipah virus encephalitis. Keywords: Nipah virus, NiV, encephalitis, Nipah virus encephalitis, surveillance, screening, infection control, paramyxovirus, nosocomial infection, Bangladesh, viruses Nipah virus (NiV) is a bat-borne paramyxovirus that causes encephalitis in humans and can be transmitted from person to person, posing a global pandemic threat (14). Because of the high costs of laboratory-based surveillance systems, maintaining surveillance for highly fatal but rare diseases, such as NiV encephalitis, is difficult for low-income countries, such as Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, NiV encephalitis outbreaks with a >70% case-fatality rate have occurred almost every year since 2001 during DecemberApril (35). Where NiV encephalitis outbreaks had been repeatedly identified, the Institute for Epidemiology Disease Control and Research of the Government of Bangladesh, in collaboration with icddr,b, started hospital-based encephalitis surveillance in February 2006. Before illness onset, nearly every NiV encephalitis case-patient identified in Bangladesh was exposed either to raw or fermented date palm sap or to another NiV encephalitis case-patient (36). Bangladeshis collect and drink raw date palm sap fresh during DecemberApril (35). Pteropus fruit bats come in contact with date palm sap by landing on the sap stream and contaminate sap with saliva and/or urine (7,8). NiV RNA has been identified in human blood, urine, respiratory secretions, and saliva (4,9). Epidemiologic studies indicate that respiratory secretions and saliva are the most likely vehicles of NiV transmission from patients to caregivers (3,4). Therefore, implementation of standard, contact, and droplet precautions (10) could reduce NiV transmission in hospitals. However, hospitals with few resources for infection control are unable to implement standard, contact, and droplet precautions for all patients with encephalitis (11), which places caregivers at risk for person-to-person transmission of NiV (4,12). Because no rapid diagnostic tests for NiV infection are currently available, surveillance for NiV encephalitis in Bangladesh relies on a central laboratory in the capital (Dhaka) to confirm diagnosis several days or weeks after sample collection. Earlier identification of NiV encephalitis cases would enable targeted infection control efforts to reduce the number of persons exposed to NiV-infected patients and thereby reduce subsequent secondary transmission of NiV from person to person. The objective of this study was to compare the performance of screening questions about recent exposure to date palm sap or other encephalitis patients with serologic testing results to more quickly identify NiV encephalitis cases in our surveillance hospitals. The Study Since 2006, surveillance physicians have listed and collected blood from those patients encephalitis, defined as fever or history of fever with axillary temperature >38.5C (101.3F) and altered mental status, new onset of seizures, or new neurologic deficitin patients admitted to 3 Nipah surveillance hospitals: Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Faridpur Medical College hospitals. The Institute for Epidemiology Disease Control and Research and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested serum with an IgM-capture enzyme immunoassay to detect NiV IgM, and we defined laboratory-confirmed NiV encephalitis as NiV IgM in serum. During December 2012March 2013, surveillance physicians interviewed accompanying caregivers of all hospitalized patients whose illness met the encephalitis case definition on admission in the inpatient ward. Study physicians asked about patients consumption of raw or fermented date palm sap and contact with other persons with fever and altered mental status in the month before illness onset; if caregivers were unaware of the patients exposures, study physicians asked them phone the patients friends and colleagues about exposures. Exposures were recorded in surveillance log books. Hospital physicians used personal protection equipment and provided it to caregivers of each patient with encephalitis and a history of these exposures. As part of subsequent epidemiologic studies, we also conducted detailed case investigations at each NiV encephalitis case-patients household. We interviewed surviving patients directly, or appropriate proxies among family, friends and relatives for patients who died, about their exposures to encephalitis patients or to fresh or fermented date palm sap before illness. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the screening questions asked on admissions to hospitals by comparing with the NiV IgM results. We repeated the calculations for patients hospitalized during January and February, when the prevalence of NiV encephalitis is highest. We compared the answers provided by caregivers during patient hospitalization with those provided during interviews in the community as part of our epidemiologic studies. icddr,bs Ethical Review Committee reviewed and approved the protocol for NiV surveillance and case investigation. Surveillance physicians identified 360 patients with encephalitis during December 2012March 2013. They collected and tested blood samples from 328 (91%) patients for NiV IgM. Seventeen (5%) had NiV IgM (Table 1), of whom 15 (88%) NiV encephalitis case-patients were identified during January and February 2013. Of the 17 confirmed case-patients, family caregivers of 14 reported either a history of drinking raw or fermented date palm sap or contact with other persons with fever and altered mental status in the month before illness onset. Therefore, the sensitivity of the screening questions was 82%, specificity was 86%, PPV was 24% and NPV was 99% (Table 2). The sensitivity during JanuaryFebruary was 93%, specificity was 82%, PPV was 37%, and NPV was 99%.

At admission, 3 (18%) NiV encephalitis case-patients had no reported history of drinking raw or fermented date palm sap or of contact with persons who had encephalitis (Table 1). However, during the epidemiologic investigations in the community, family members of 2 case-patients reported that the patients drank fermented date palm sap in the month before illness onset. Of the 14 NiV encephalitis case-patients who, at admission, had reported 1 of the risk exposures, results were consistent with exposures reported during the epidemiologic investigation. Conclusions Screening patients with possible encephalitis at the time they seek hospital care regarding recent exposure to date palm sap and to other patients with encephalitis demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for detecting NiV encephalitis, particularly during peak months of NiV encephalitis incidence. The high NPV of the screening questions suggests that focusing infection control efforts toward patients with these exposures is an efficient use of scarce resources to prevent transmission. Although three fourths of encephalitis patients had reported histories of exposure, they possibly could have had other infections, including other bat-borne viruses, that were transmitted through similar routes or could have lacked NiV IgM, despite having NiV infection (13). Alternatively, recent consumption of date palm sap by these patients might have been purely coincidental because this practice is common in Bangladesh during this season, but Nipah infection is rare. For 2 NiV encephalitis case-patients, caregivers did not report a history of drinking fermented date palm sap during hospital interview, but this behavior was reported in later community investigations. Because 90% of Bangladeshis are Muslim, and consumption of alcohol is prohibited by Islam (14) and illegal in Bangladesh, patients might be reluctant to report drinking traditional liquor made of fermented date palm sap. Therefore, caregivers should be asked about socially stigmatized behaviors privately and confidentially to increase the odds that these stigmatized behaviors are reported.","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4313652/"}

Use of molecular targeted drugs, such as specific kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, is a possible solution to overcome this limitation and has achieved clinical success so far. Use of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is a rational strategy for improving efficacy and reducing systemic adverse events. ADCs use antibodies selectively to deliver a potent cytotoxic agent to tumor cells, thus drastically improving the therapeutic index of chemotherapeutic agents. Lessons learned from clinical failure of early ADCs during the 1980s to 90s have recently led to improvements in ADC technology, and resulted in the approval of four novel ADCs. Nonetheless, further advances in ADC technology are still required to streamline their clinical efficacy and reduce toxicity. [fam-] Trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) is a next-generation ADC that satisfies these requirements based on currently available evidence. DS-8201a has several innovative features; a highly potent novel payload with a high drug-to-antibody ratio, good homogeneity, a tumor-selective cleavable linker, stable linker-payload in circulation, and a short systemic half-life cytotoxic agent in vivo; the released cytotoxic payload could exert a bystander effect. With respect to its preclinical profiles, DS-8201a could provide a valuable therapy with a great potential against HER2-expressing cancers in clinical settings. In a phase I trial, DS-8201a showed acceptable safety profiles with potential therapeutic efficacy, with the wide therapeutic index. Keywords: antibodydrug conjugate; antitumor; drug delivery.

Exceptionally few bacteriocins along with their native antibacterial property also exhibit additional anti-viral and anti-fungal properties. Bacteriocins are generally produced by Gm+, Gm- and archaea bacteria. Bacteriocins from Gm + bacteria especially from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been thoroughly investigated considering their great biosafety and broad industrial applications. LAB expressing bacteriocins were isolated from fermented milk and milk products, rumen of animals and soil using deferred antagonism assay. Nisin is the only bacteriocin that has got FDA approval for application as a food preservative, which is produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. Its crystal structure explains that its antimicrobial properties are due to the binding of NH2 terminal to lipid II molecule inhibiting the peptidoglycan synthesis and carboxy terminal forming pores in bacterial cell membrane leading to cell lysis. The hinge region connecting NH2 and carboxy terminus has been mutated to generate mutant variants with higher antimicrobial activity. In a 50 ton fermentation of the mutant strain 3807 derived from L. lactis ATCC 11454, 9,960 IU/mL of nisin was produced. Currently, high purity of nisin (>99%) is very expensive and hardly commercially available. Development of more advanced tools for cost-effective separation and purification of nisin would be commercially attractive. Chemical synthesis and heterologous expression of bacteriocins ended in low yields of pure proteins. At present, bacteriocins are almost solely applied in food industries, but they have a great potential to be used in other fields such as feeds, organic fertilizers, environmental protection and personal care products. The future of bacteriocins is largely dependent on getting FDA approval for use of other bacteriocins in addition to nisin to promote the research and applications.

Globally, there are 2.9 million cholera cases annually. Individuals living in close proximity to cholera cases are at a higher risk for developing cholera compared to the general population. Targeted water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions have the potential to reduce cholera transmission in cholera hotspots around cholera cases. The objective of this study was to expand the scope of the Cholera-Hospital-Based-Intervention-for-7-Days (CHoBI7) program, focused on cholera patient households, for delivery in cholera hotspots in urban slums in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Thirty-one semi-structured interviews were conducted in cholera hotspots around cholera patients, and three intervention planning workshops were conducted to inform modifications needed to the CHoBI7 program. After exploratory interviews, a two-phase, iterative pilot study was conducted for 9 months to test the developed CHoBI7 Cholera Rapid Response program among 180 participants to further inform modifications to intervention content and delivery. Findings from pilot participant interviews highlighted the need to adapt intervention content for delivery at the compound-rather than household-level, given an environment with multiple households sharing a water source, toilets, and kitchen facilities. This was addressed by conducting a \"ring session\" for intervention delivery in cholera hotspots for households to discuss how to improve their shared facilities together and encourage a compound-level commitment to promoted WASH behaviors and placement of soapy water bottles in shared spaces. Based on the low number of soapy water bottles observed in communal spaces during the first iteration of the pilot, we also added context-specific examples using the narratives of families in mobile messages to encourage WASH behavioral recommendations. Formative research identified important considerations for the modifications needed to tailor the CHoBI7 program for delivery in cholera hotspots in urban Bangladesh.

Quantum physics is the theoretical basis of the transistor, the laser, and other technologies which enabled the computing revolution. But on the algorithmic level, today's computing machinery still operates on \"\"classical\"\" Boolean logic. Quantum Computing is the design of hardware and software that replaces Boolean logic by quantum law at the algorithmic level. For certain computations such as optimization, sampling, search or quantum simulation this promises dramatic speedups. We are particularly interested in applying quantum computing to artificial intelligence and machine learning. This is because many tasks in these areas rely on solving hard optimization problems or performing efficient sampling.","url":"https://research.google/research-areas/quantum-computing/"}

{"doc_id":"ca6156049a16385f","title":"NIST Releases First 3 Finalized Post-Quantum Encryption Standards | NIST","content":"Department of Commerces National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has finalized its principal set of encryption algorithms designed to withstand cyberattacks from a quantum computer. Researchers around the world are racing to build quantum computers that would operate in radically different ways from ordinary computers and could break the current encryption that provides security and privacy for just about everything we do online. The algorithms announced today are specified in the first completed standards from NISTs post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization project, and are ready for immediate use. The three new standards are built for the future. Quantum computing technology is developing rapidly, and some experts predict that a device with the capability to break current encryption methods could appear within a decade, threatening the security and privacy of individuals, organizations and entire nations. Want to about post-quantum cryptography? Check out our explainer. The advancement of quantum computing plays an essential role in reaffirming Americas status as a global technological powerhouse and driving the future of our economic security, said Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves. Commerce bureaus are doing their part to ensure U.S. competitiveness in quantum, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is at the forefront of this whole-of-government effort. NIST is providing invaluable expertise to develop innovative solutions to our quantum challenges, including security measures like post-quantum cryptography that organizations can start to implement to secure our post-quantum future. As this decade-long endeavor continues, we look forward to continuing Commerces legacy of leadership in this vital space. The standards containing the encryption algorithms computer code, instructions for how to implement them, and their intended uses are the result of an eight-year effort managed by NIST, which has a long history of developing encryption. The agency has rallied the worlds cryptography experts to conceive, submit and then evaluate cryptographic algorithms that could resist the assault of quantum computers. The nascent technology could revolutionize fields from weather forecasting to fundamental physics to drug design, but it carries threats as well. Encryption carries a heavy load in modern digitized society. It protects countless electronic secrets, such as the contents of email messages, medical records and photo libraries, as well as information vital to national security. Encrypted data can be sent across public computer networks because it is unreadable to all but its sender and intended recipient. Encryption tools rely on complex math problems that conventional computers find difficult or impossible to solve. A sufficiently capable quantum computer, though, would be able to sift through a vast number of potential solutions to these problems very quickly, thereby defeating current encryption. The algorithms NIST has standardized are based on different math problems that would stymie both conventional and quantum computers. These finalized standards include instructions for incorporating them into products and encryption systems, said NIST mathematician Dustin Moody, who heads the PQC standardization project. We encourage system administrators to start integrating them into their systems immediately, because full integration will take time. Moody said that these standards are the primary tools for general encryption and protecting digital signatures. NIST also continues to evaluate two other sets of algorithms that could one day serve as backup standards. One of these sets consists of three algorithms designed for general encryption but based on a different type of math problem than the general-purpose algorithm in the finalized standards. NIST plans to announce its selection of one or two of these algorithms by the end of 2024. The second set includes a larger group of algorithms designed for digital signatures. In order to accommodate any ideas that cryptographers may have had since the initial 2016 call for submissions, NIST asked the public for additional algorithms in 2022 and has begun a process of evaluating them. In the near future, NIST expects to announce about 15 algorithms from this group that will proceed to the next round of testing, evaluation and analysis. While analysis of these two additional sets of algorithms will continue, Moody said that any subsequent PQC standards will function as backups to the three that NIST announced today. There is no need to wait for future standards, he said. Go ahead and start using these three. We need to be prepared in case of an attack that defeats the algorithms in these three standards, and we will continue working on backup plans to keep our data safe. But for most applications, these new standards are the main event. Encryption uses math to protect sensitive electronic information, including secure websites and emails. Widely used public-key encryption systems, which rely on math problems that computers find intractable, ensure that these websites and messages are inaccessible to unwelcome third parties. Before making the selections, NIST considered not only the security of the algorithms underlying math, but also the best applications for them. The new standards are designed for two essential tasks for which encryption is typically used: general encryption, used to protect information exchanged across a public network; and digital signatures, used for identity authentication. NIST announced its selection of four algorithms CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Sphincs+ and FALCON slated for standardization in 2022 and released draft versions of three of these standards in 2023. The fourth draft standard based on FALCON is planned for late 2024. While there have been no substantive changes made to the standards since the draft versions, NIST has changed the algorithms names to specify the versions that appear in the three finalized standards, which are: Similarly, when the draft FIPS 206 standard built around FALCON is released, the algorithm will be dubbed FN-DSA, short for FFT (fast-Fourier transform) over NTRU-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm.","url":"https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards"}
{"doc_id":"e01ec5a967124a66","title":"Movie Matchups: Who Framed Roger Rabbit vs. Chinatown | Deja Reviewer","content":"Some people have speculated that Who Framed Roger Rabbit is some sort of sequel, remake, or homage to Chinatown. But its none of those things. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is actually a perfect parody of that classic murder mystery. I would like to thank fellow blogger O Poderoso Chofer for inspiring this Movie Matchup. I probably never would have picked up on all of the parallels between these two films if he hadnt suggested the idea to me, so I owe him one. This is going to be a little different from my other Movie Matchups. Rather than simply pointing out the parallels between these two films, Im going to emphasize the comedy twists that Who Framed Roger Rabbit puts on Chinatown. Lets hop to it! Similarities First, heres a rundown of all of the similarities Im going to discuss between these two films: - Theyre both set in a similar time period in Los Angeles, though one is grounded in reality while the other presents an alternate reality in which classic cartoon characters are real actors. - The main character is hired to take pictures of a man having an affair. - He had a tragic experience in a certain part of L.A. - He explodes in anger at someone who criticizes his job. - Evidence disappears and later reappears at a pivotal point in the plot. - The main character gets roughed up by a midget in one film and a giant gorilla in the other. - A prominent businessman gets murdered. - The wife of the man who was murdered (or accused of murder) is angry at the main character at first, but later hires him to find someone. - The villain is buying up a lot of real estate for a shady scheme involving the future of L.A. - In the end, the main character has to return to the part of L.A. Now lets go in depth on each of these points. Similar Settings Chinatown takes place in 1930s Los Angeles before the city really hit the bigtime. Its setting is completely believable, which makes the events feel like history more than fiction. Who Framed Roger Rabbit turns the idea of reality on its head by presenting us with 1947 L.A. where cartoon characters live and work alongside humans. It makes sense to the child in all of us because its fun to think that cartoons are filmed just like regular feature films and the characters we love have a life beyond the films they appear in. Taking Pictures of an Affair Jake Gittes is a private investigator who is hired by a woman claiming to be Mrs. Mulwray to take pictures of Mr. Mulwray having an affair. He succeeds in taking pictures of Mr. Mulwray and another woman together, but they never actually do anything besides talk. But apparently its scintillating enough to become front-page news. Eddie Valiant is also a private eye who is hired by the head of Maroon Cartoons to spy on Roger Rabbits wife ostensibly for the purpose of helping Roger. The funny thing is that Eddie succeeds in taking pictures of Jessica Rabbit and Mr. Acme in a compromising situation they play pattycake together. This bit of silliness is enough to put Roger into a frenzie, though. Tragedy in Toontown/Chinatown Jake used to be a police officer walking the beat in Chinatown. He never goes into detail about what happened to him during his time in Chinatown, but he says that he had an experience where he was supposed to help someone, but he wound up hurting them. He cant stand to go to Chinatown as a result. Eddie used to be a cop with his brother and they would often work in Toontown helping toons solve crimes. But one day they were attacked by a malicious toon who dropped a piano on them, breaking Eddies arm and killing his brother. Its kind of hard not to laugh about that tragedy. A piano dropped on someones head? I know Im supposed to be sad about that, but I just cant help thinking of Wile E. Coyote or Sylvester the Cat getting comically crushed by a heavy falling object. Eddie hasnt been able to bring himself to return to Toontown for several years since that experience. You Wanna Step Outside? After exposing Mr. Mulwrays affair, Jake is criticized by a fellow patron getting a haircut at a barber shop. Jake gets really defensive and tells the man to step outside so they can duke it out. Eddie has a similar encounter at a bar. When a fellow bar patron hears that Eddie is doing a job for Mr. Maroon he implies that Eddie is working for a toon. Eddie takes that as a personal insult, kicks the guys barstool out from under him and shoves a hardboiled egg in the guys mouth as he forcefully declares he doesnt work for toons. Disappearing, Reappearing Evidence When Jake goes over to the Mulwrays house to talk, he notices something reflecting light in a little pond in their backyard, but he doesnt have time to fish it out right then. He later discovers what it was he spotted down there: a pair of glasses belonging to Mr. Acme, he gets squirted with some ink that disappears on his shirt almost instantly. Later, Acme delivers his will to Jessica Rabbit, but she only sees a blank piece of paper. Roger even writes a love letter to Jessica on it. Acme gets murdered over the contents of that will. At the end of the film, the ink reappears on Eddies shirt, which makes him realize that Acme wrote his will with the same ink, and suddenly the wills words materialize underneath Rogers silly love letter. The Midget and the Monkey During his investigation of Mr. Mulwrays death, Jake gets cornered by some thugs. One of them, who he calls a midget, cuts Jakes nose as a warning to stay away. The cut doesnt keep him from pursuing his investigation, though. When Eddie tries to peep on Jessica and Mr. Acme at a club, a big gorilla bouncer literally tosses him out. Eddie doesnt receive any lasting scars like Jake just a wounded pride. He still finds a way to take pictures of those two playing pattycake. Murder Most Goofy Jake sneaks into a crime scene where an old friend of his (who is now a police lieutenant) informs him that Mr. Mulwray has been killed. They fish his body out of some water. Eddie gets awakened by an old friend (who is also, coincidentally, a police lieutenant) who informs him that Mr. He takes Eddie to the crime scene where Mr. Acmes body is being carted off after having his head crushed by a safe. Again, the filmmakers find ways to add levity to a scene that was played very seriously in Chinatown. I Hate You Youre Hired! After hearing about Jakes pictures of her husband, Mrs. Mulwray threatens Jake with a lawsuit. However, when her husband is killed she drops the lawsuit and hires him to find her sister. He winds up sleeping with her in the course of his investigation. He knows shes keeping secrets from him, but he cant help being drawn to her. After hearing that Roger is the primary suspect in the murder of Mr. Acme, Jessica Rabbit slaps Eddie for helping frame him with his compromising pictures of her. Soon after that, she has a change of heart and offers to pay Eddie to find Roger for her. He winds up half-naked with her in a funny scene where the innuendo is played for laughs. He doesnt trust her and he can never really tell whose side shes on. In her defense, she says that she cant help it that she looks guilty, but shes just drawn that way. The Land Grab In Chinatown, Jake eventually learns that Mr. Mulwray was killed by his former business partner over a real-estate swindle worth millions of dollars. A corrupt businessman is withholding water from local farmers to send the price of their land into a tailspin. He then buys up huge tracts of land under false names and prepares to annex it all into L.A. as a way of securing the citys future. The villain in Who Framed Roger Rabbit is much less subtle, as one would expect from a cartoon bad guy. He sets up a front organization in which he is the sole shareholder. He buys up L.A.s public transportation company and all the land in Toontown once Mr. Acmes will fails to materialize, which would have given the land to the toons, themselves. The villain plans to destroy Toontown and replace it with a freeway. He says freeways are the future, and he means to make bucket loads of money off them. Forget It, Jake Its Toontown In the end, Jake is forced to return to Chinatown in order to try to help Mrs. Mulwray and her sister escape from the villain. But the villain catches up to them and has Mrs. Mulwray killed and all the evidence of his wrongdoing destroyed so that he will get away scot-free. Jake just has to live with the fact that he couldnt redeem himself his second time around in Chinatown. Eddie is forced to face his fears and enter Toontown once again in search of a killer. The villain soon captures Eddie, Jessica, and Roger. Hes going to kill them all and bring his plan of toon genocide to fruition, but Eddie manages to thwart him with some quick thinking and cartoony hijinks. In the end, Eddie gets to take revenge on the toon who murdered his brother and save all of Toontown. Where Gritty Meets Witty Chinatown is a grim, gritty story about one man who learns that he is unable to stop larger forces from having their way. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a lighthearted story about one mans redemption, which he earns by helping a cartoon rabbit prove his innocence. At first glance, these two stories might not seem to have much in common, but now hopefully you can see that Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a brilliant parody of Chinatown. From the setting to the setups and payoffs, Who Framed Roger Rabbit turns all of the seriousness and drama of Chinatown on its ears and has a lot of fun doing it. Thats all, folks!

{"doc_id":"56608b1516d952c8","title":"On Class, Capitalism and Urban Planning in Who Framed Roger Rabbit ‹ CrimeReads","content":"[This essay contains spoilers for Who Framed Roger Rabbit] Ive been wondering what Who Framed Roger Rabbit asks of its audience, besides the inquiry that gives the film its title and the movie its directionwhich, by the way, might not even be a proper inquiry, since the title doesnt have a question mark (although that seems to be kind of the point). The movie traffics in perhaps the greatest suspension of disbelief in all of cinemathe assertion of the real-world coexistence of cartoon characters and actual humans. This is such a big hurdle because the addition of something so obviously manmade as animation into a live-action movie makes us remember that what were watching is fake, and maybe also reminds us that all film is inherently artificial anyway, even when there arent any cartoons. Cinemas history of brief cartoon cameos, which includes Mickey Mouse talking to the shadow of Leopold Stokowski in Fantasia (1941) and the extended hand-drawn sequences in Mary Poppins (1964) and Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971) are supposed to take place inside imagination or via magic. But Roger Rabbit, directed by Robert Zemeckis in 1988, suggests that cartoons are real, viable parts of the regular world. And they make the world much more dazzling by being in it! I should mention, before I say anything else, that the special effects in Roger Rabbit are breathtaking; the films integration of cartoons and real people is both seamless and spectacular. Writing out a plot summary of Roger Rabbit (which is based on the novel by Gary K. Wolf), I realize the volume of what the film asks its audience to buy: cartoon characters are real, and cartoon shorts and films are filmed just like regular ones: in Hollywood, with multiple takes, yelling directors, and expensive sets. Toons, as theyre called, are drawn into existence, but wind up living autonomous, three-dimensional lives that have little to do with what they look like (at one point, the femme-fatale Jessica Rabbit explains of her vampish look, Im not bad, Im just drawn that way). Toons are both totally elastic and are highly durable (dropping safes on top of them wont do a thing besides send swirly rings of color through their eyes and cause cartoon birds to tweet in circles around their heads). All they generally want to do is be happy and make people laugh. And they live in their own neighborhood in Los Angeles, a Technicolor sing-along paradise called Toontown, which is not governed by the laws of physics and which humans rarely enter. This is already a mouthful, so its lucky that Roger Rabbit is a cartoon (if there were ever a film that could unhinge its own jaw). The film, which is set in 1947, gets going when a human noir-style P.I. named Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is hired by the president of a cartoon short-film studio called Maroon Cartoons to investigate a possible scandal in the personal life of one of its biggest stars, Roger Rabbit (Charles Fleisher), a goofy giant rabbit in suspenders and a bow-tie. Maroon wants evidence that Rogers wife Jessica (a sultry cartoon woman with a figure inspired by Rita Hayworth and a voice provided by Kathleen Turner) is cheating on him with the human Marvin Acme, the king of the prop industry and the jolly landlord of Toontown (an elderly Stubby Kaye). Eddie, a traumatized, sardonic alcoholic, is reluctant, because he hates Toons (a Toon killed his brother, who was also his partner in the P.I. business), but he gets the evidence just the same. But then, Marvin Acme is found murdered, and all signs point to Roger (who in his despair, has disappearedby running through a wall and leaving a cutout of his body behind). Suddenly, Eddie winds up having to clear Rogers name. Along the way, he bumps into famous cartoon characters, from Disney movies to Mickey Mouse shorts to Looney Toons adventures to a down-and-out Betty Boop, painted in black-and-white and working as a waitress ever since cartoons went to color. Which is, when you think about it, kind of heartbreaking. Details like the small Betty Boop backstory are what make Roger Rabbit complexthat is, besides, the thousands of other odds-and-ends it juggles. See, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a hardboiled crime story just as much as it is a colorful cartoon comedy. It takes on two completely different cinematic traditions and is able to keep one foot solidly in each (the film, like its star, is surreally flexible, and not bothered by rules). And it does this with the only possible connection between these two distinct moviemaking canons: the city of Los Angeles, itself. The noir story, which becomes rather Chinatown-esque (as Janet Maslin noted in her original review of the film in The New York Times), and the backlot story are both deeply rooted in a storytelling history that seeks to understand the development of the physical place of Los Angeles in such a way that allowed it to become a hub of cultural elitism. In Roger Rabbit, the murder of Marvin Acme is revealed to be a convenient real-estate grab, by the menacing Judge Doom (a sinister Christopher Lloyd), who has already bought out and destroyed Los Angeless cable car network. Judge Doom longs to acquire Toontown so that he can bulldoze it and turn it into a freeway. Just as Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a clever reimagining of the movie industry that invented cartoon animation, it is also an alternate history of Los Angeless transportation systems. And through this, its a story about neighborhood re-development, urban planning power-grabs, and gentrification and through this all: class. Despite its hand-drawn aesthetic, anti-gravity antics, silly sound effects, and ceaseless funny business, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a grim and very serious movie about the disenfranchisement of a group within society labeled as lower-class. *** The Toons in Roger Rabbit are distinctly second-tier citizens. Their presence is only wanted in the human world because its entertaining (no character better emphasizes this than the sexy animated woman Jessica, whose main gig is singing before a crowd of thirsty human men at a cabaret), and when its anything else, its too much and inconvenient. When theyre not entertaining, they spend their time in their own specific neighborhood, which is owned by a tycoonand precarious, because of this. It turns out that Marvin Acme has bequeathed Toontown to the residents, and that Judge Doom has been searching for his will, to destroy it, to grant his possession of the neighborhood. The Toons receiving collective ownership of their own land is the films happy ending.The Toons receiving collective ownership of their own land is the films happy ending. Just as much as its residents are fabricated, though, this defeat is a fantasy. In real life, whole neighborhoods in LA were razed for the construction of its enormous highway system, which consists of seven separate freeways and which was constructed, in discrete parts, from 1944-1965. The government seized property from lower-class neighborhoods, particularly in East Los Angeles, displacing many (particularly large swaths of LAs Mexican-American community), and destroying many historic and locally-significant landmarks, including Hollenbeck Park in the Boyle Heights neighborhood. Obviously, in real life, neighborhood destruction and urban development policies which target low-class communities are fundamentally racist, as wellbecause the system does not allow certain ethic groups upward mobility in the first place, most low-class areas are also where non-white communities live. City planning exists to make such spaces more convenient and accessible for classes which are both upper and white, at the grievous expense of everyone else. Its not uncommon for noir which tackles large-scale city government policies to reveal how racism factors in; in Chinatown, for example, the oppression of the Los Angeles Chinese-American community is a secret, underlying theme, bubbling up underneath all the interpersonal drama between the wealthy white people who make up the themes main cast, to suggest a history of subjugation that runs even deeper than even the abyss of the corruption the main detective is investigating. Its worth stating here that though Roger Rabbits noir-coating allows it to call these themes to mind, the film itself does not seem to make an argument about how race is endemic to these policies, which seems good in this case because, in order to do that, it would have to problematically allegorize L.A.s displaced POC communities as non-human cartoons. The Toons of Roger Rabbit ultimately bear a kind of whitenessnot just the caricature Jessica, who is literally white, but in their origins, having been produced by a white hegemonic imagination and a very white Hollywood, in real life. Notably, George Herrimans Krazy Kat, a cartoon strip which ran from 1913 to 1944 and reflected much more deeply about race in America (influenced, in part, by Herrimans own identity as a white-passing black man), is not one of the Toons in Roger Rabbit, despite its having been animated several times. Roger Rabbit for the most part sails over these thornier issues, excoriating the social destruction inherent to capitalism without going into too much detail about its specific victimsrepresenting its cartoons as a kind of alternate anthropomorphized species (creatures living in their own particular ecosystem, one which is threatened by human greed) in a world where race doesnt really exist. *** The big message at the end of Roger Rabbit is about the importance of laughter and fun and friendship and community. Eddie Valiant learns how to laugh again, but also how to love. That our protagonist learns both of these things at the same time is a very satisfying ending for Roger Rabbit, which relies on our love of cartoons just as much as our inclination to laugh because of them.","url":"https://crimereads.com/roger-rabbit/"}

{"doc_id":"4d63113e2490b5df","title":"After the Monsoon Revolution: A Roadmap to Lasting Security Sector Reform in Bangladesh | HRW","content":"Summary Following a massive protest movement in Bangladesh that toppled the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, politicians, civil society, students, diplomats, United Nations rights experts, and others quickly started work with an interim government to bring lasting reforms. Led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, the interim government took office on August 8, 2024, pledging to undo the damage to human rights and democracy during the Hasina administrations 15 years in office. As Chief Advisor Yunus told Prothom Alo: We don't want flimsy reforms. We don't want eye-wash reforms. We want fundamental reforms. We will bring about these reforms in such a manner that they cannot be changed by anyone. After winning the 2009 election, Sheikh Hasinas Awami League party-led government had gradually consolidated power by silencing critics, harassing activists, and arbitrarily arresting, forcibly disappearing, and killing members of the opposition or civil society who spoke out against her. In January 2024, Sheikh Hasina won a fourth consecutive term in office after her administration again refused to hold credible elections, marking a decade since Bangladeshis had been able to exercise their right to choose their leaders. During her reign, the Hasina-led government effectively captured key institutions that otherwise could offer independent oversight and justice including the election commission, the human rights commission, the police, and the judiciary, ensuring that they instead served to keep the Awami League in office. On August 5, 2024, Hasina was finally forced to leave office after three weeks of student-led street protests, described by some Bangladeshis as the Monsoon Revolution. The interim government has committed to holding free and fair elections after repairing the security sector, the justice system, and other core institutions. The interim government has also said that it will bring legislative changes through presidential order, which will later be ratified by an elected parliament. While embarking upon these critical steps, the interim government is also contending with powerful and politicized security forces that have long benefited from a system of impunity. Due to the deeply ingrained systemic obstacles to accountable governance, a disturbingly familiar pattern of security force abuses and political reprisals has reemerged, this time targeting perceived Awami League supporters. Groups promoting extremist Islam are attacking minorities, particularly those from Hindu and Ahmadiyya communities. Ethnic minorities in the Chittagong Hill Tracts endure continued discrimination and violence by the authorities. While the interim government has introduced a new ordinance to replace an abusive law used to crush freedom of speech under the Awami League, the new legislation unfortunately replicates many of the same harmful provisions. Student leaders and activists are expressing concern that the interim government is being hemmed in by various political interests at home and abroad. Many are worried that the pace of reforms has slowed down. As one student leader said: In Bangladeshs history, repeatedly, whoever has been in power, people have had to shed blood to restore democracy. We would like lasting reforms, strong institutions, and empowered people, so that there is never again scope for authoritarianism. No Bangladeshi should have to sacrifice their life again to win democracy. Bangladeshis have called for rights respecting governance. This effort, led by a fragile interim government that seeks to remain politically neutral, must be robustly supported by donors, international experts, and civil society. Most significantly, the criminal justice system should uphold international standards on the presumption of innocence and the right to due process as perpetrators of serious human rights violations are identified through investigations. To ensure effective reforms, the government has sought input from stakeholders. This report draws on over 20 years of Human Rights Watch reporting on abuses in Bangladesh both under the Hasina administration and by those before her, as well as interviews with human rights activists, members of the interim government, and current and former law enforcement and military officialsto set out the structural reforms needed for lasting change. The Monsoon Revolution Violence first erupted on July 15, 2024, when the ruling Awami League party supporters and police attacked students peacefully protesting discriminatory and politicized quotas in government jobs. Students across the country launched protests in response. The Hasina government deployed security forces who used tear gas, stun grenades, and rubber and live bullets, shooting indiscriminately into crowds and directly at students. As one police officer told Human Rights Watch, I witnessed officers firing at vital organs. In many cases, I witnessed live ammunition being fired even when officers lives were not in danger. Another described witnessing senior officers in the Dhaka Metropolitan Police Headquarters watch live CCTV footage and direct officers on the ground to shoot protesters like they were ordering someone to shoot in a video game. A July 16 video spread rapidly on social media showing university student Abu Sayed standing, his arms outstretched, as police repeatedly shot at him. After his death, and the deaths of others, outraged students across the country came out in the streets and were later joined by ordinary citizens and opposition supporters. The protests soon expanded to represent opposition to Hasinas autocratic rule, characterized by security force abuses, widespread repression, and corruption, with slogans calling for her resignation. As protests spread, the authorities instituted a strict curfew enforced with a shoot-on-sight order, imposed a nationwide internet shutdown, and arrested thousands of people. One student, Mohammad Rahat Husain, described to Human Rights Watch being shot at by police when he and his friends were sitting at a teashop during the curfew. Despite hiding inside the shop, police charged inside and told the students to run. But when one of his friends, Tayem, started to run, police shot him from behind. I tried to drag him away, but the police kept firing, and a rubber bullet hit my leg. Tayem was dying, with his wrists limp and his eyes staring blankly. The last words he said to me were: Bhai, leave me. I started running, but they fired at me again. This time, I wasnt hit. I was screaming for someone to help Tayem. Despite the grave risks, thousands continued to protest. On August 4, protesters marched towards the prime ministers residence demanding that she resign. Hasina responded by reportedly calling on officials to curb anarchists with iron hands. But as the streets filled with protesters threatening to overrun government buildings, on August 5, Sheikh Hasina fled the country. Now exiled in India, she has claimed that she left to prevent further bloodshed and has denied any wrongdoing. The Yunus administration, alongside Students Against Discrimination, the group that had led the protests, continue to update the list of those killed. As of December 2024, they confirmed at least 858 deaths. Another nearly 250 people, including policemen, were killed in retributive violence after Hasinas resignation. Interim Government Within weeks of taking power, the Yunus administration released thousands of people who had been detained during the protests and made commitments to pursue accountability for torture, extrajudicial killings, and enforced disappearances, and ensure human rights protections. It has said it will drop police investigations and charges against peaceful critics of Sheikh Hasina, her relatives and associates, and her administration. At least 30 police officials were arrested for their alleged involvement in using unlawful force against protesters during the Monsoon Revolution. The interim government also invited the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to investigate abuses by government forces during the protests and their root causes. A commission of inquiry into all enforced disappearances, established on August 27, has made significant progress in identifying secret detention sites and has named some perpetrators, a monumental step after years of denials by the previous government. The interim government has also acceded to the UN Convention on Enforced Disappearances and has invited assistance from the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. On September 12, the interim government formed six commissions to recommend reforms to the judiciary, the electoral system, public administration, police, the anti-corruption office, and the constitution. It later established four additional commissions to make policy recommendations on media, health, labor rights, and womens rights. Students who led the protests have a voice in these commissions. As of writing, the six main commissions are expected to submit their recommendations by January 15 (January 31 for the judicial reform commission). Then another commission will be formed, comprising the heads of the six commissions, which will be chaired by the chief advisor, Yunus, to forge a consensus around reforms and then to initiate implementation. Despite these important steps, police have returned to the abusive practices that characterized the previous government, this time targeting supportersor perceived supportersof the Awami League government. For instance, in the first two months since the interim government took office, over 1,000 police cases were filed against tens of thousands of people, mainly Awami League members, accusing them of murder, corruption, or other crimes. Over 400 Awami League ministers and leaders are facing investigations. In some of these cases, complainants were not even aware of who was being named as accused.","url":"https://www.hrw.org/report/2025/01/27/after-monsoon-revolution/roadmap-lasting-security-sector-reform-bangladesh"}
{"doc_id":"42b6b3fa0c36e3dc","title":"Bangladesh: Sheikh Hasina sentenced to death over student protests","content":"Bangladesh's ousted leader Sheikh Hasina sentenced to death Bangladesh's former prime minister has been sentenced to death for crimes against humanity over her crackdown on student-led protests which led to her ousting. Sheikh Hasina was found guilty of allowing lethal force to be used against protesters, 1,400 of whom died during the unrest last year. Hasina, 78, was tried in absentia by the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Bangladesh, having been exiled in India since she was forced from power in July 2024. Prosecutors accused her of being behind hundreds of killings during the protests. Hasina has denied all charges, calling the trial \"biased and politically motivated\". The months-long tribunal in the ICT, Bangladesh's domestic war crimes court, was widely expected to find her guilty. But the verdict marks a pivotal moment for the nation, vindicating protests that found their roots in anger over years of repression under her rule. It also poses a diplomatic challenge for India and Bangladesh. Dhaka has formally requested Hasina's extradition but so far Delhi has shown no willingness to comply - so her death sentence is unlikely to be carried out. Hasina had governed Bangladesh for 15 years, overseeing economic progress, but increasingly attempting to silence opposition, with politically-motivated arrests, disappearances and extra-judicial killings. The protests saw Hasina forced to flee and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus installed as leader of an interim government. Reacting to the verdict on Monday in a five-page statement, Hasina said the death penalty was the interim government's way of \"nullifying [her party] the Awami League as a political force\" and that she was proud of her government's record on human rights. \"I am not afraid to face my accusers in a proper tribunal where the evidence can be weighed and tested fairly.\" Bangladesh's interim government called the sentence \"historic\" and \"profound\" but called for calm, adding that emotions could run high over the outcome. Meanwhile, Judge Golam Mortuza Mozumder said Hasina was found guilty on three counts including incitement, ordering killings and failing to prevent atrocities during the uprising. \"We have decided to inflict her with only one sentence - that is, sentence of death,\" he said. The student-led uprising last year started with demands to abolish government job quotas but morphed into a wider anti-government movement. UN human rights investigators said in a report in February that the approximately 1,400 deaths could amount to \"crimes against humanity\". The report documented the shooting at point-blank range of some protesters, the deliberate maiming of others, arbitrary arrests and torture. Reacting to Hasina's sentence, the UN Human Rights Office said this was an \"important moment for victims\" - but it regretted the \"imposition of the death penalty, which we oppose in all circumstances\". Leaked audio of one of Hasina's phone calls verified by BBC Eye earlier this year suggested she had authorised the use of \"lethal weapons\" in July 2024. The audio was played in court during the trial. Ahead of the verdict, the capital, Dhaka, where the tribunal took place, was under tightened security, with many of Hasina's critics staging a rally and cheering as the judgement was read. The city has seen a recent spike in unrest, with dozens of bombs exploded and buses set on fire in the days leading up to the verdict. At least one bomb explosion was reported in Dhaka on Monday morning, with no casualties reported, local police official Jisanul Haque told the BBC. Family members of those killed during the protests earlier told the BBC they wanted Hasina to be punished severely. Ramjan Ali, whose brother was shot dead in July 2024, said he wanted \"exemplary punishment\" for Hasina and others who have \"committed acts of vengeance and abused their power\". Lucky Akther, whose husband was killed near Dhaka in August 2024, said she wanted Hasina's sentence to be \"carried out before the election\". \"Only then the families of those killed [in the protests] will find peace in their hearts.\" Since Hasina's ousting, an interim government led by economist Muhammad Yunus has taken charge. A parliamentary election is scheduled for February 2026. However, the Awami League, Hasina's political party, was banned by Bangladesh's interim government in May. Hasina warned last month that if the party's candidates were banned from standing in the upcoming election, millions would boycott the vote. Hasina's state-appointed lawyer Mohammad Amir Hossain said he was \"sad [and wishes] the verdict had been different\". \"I even cannot appeal because my clients are absent; that's why I am sad,\" he added. Last week, Hasina's lawyers said they had filed an urgent appeal to the UN, raising serious fair trial and due process issues at the ICT. She says she has \"repeatedly challenged\" the interim government to bring its charges to the International Criminal Court in the Hague. Hasina was tried alongside her former home minister and police chief. While the sentence offers some closure to families of killed in the protests, it may do little to soothe the country's political divisions. \"The anger against Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League has not subsided,\" Shireen Huq, a Dhaka-based rights activists told the BBC. \"Neither she nor the party has apologised or shown any remorse for the killings of hundreds of people.\" She said \"it makes it difficult for the party to be accepted by a majority of people in this country\". Ms Huq, who is against capital punishment, added that the punishment was not closure for the families of those killed and injured. \"We work with several people who lost their limbs forever, they are amputees now, due to the crackdown. They will never be able to forgive her.\" David Bergman, a journalist and a long-time Bangladesh watcher, said the \"very nature of the conviction could make it even more difficult\" for Awami League to become a normal feature of Bangladeshi politics again. This may change if \"there is some kind of apology and a distancing from Sheikh Hasina and the old leadership\", he said.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwvg99e8vdo"}
{"doc_id":"4ce9b84cc2a361f7","title":"Bangladesh: Hasina’s trial begins","content":"The in absentia trial of Sheikh Hasina, the former prime minister of Bangladesh, started on 3 August 2025 in the countrys International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Dhaka. Hasina is accused of crimes against humanity in relation to a bloody crackdown on people protesting against her government in July and early August 2024 which killed hundreds. Bangladeshs health ministry has confirmed a list of over 800 people killed during the protests, though in its opening statement in court, the prosecution alleged that over 1400 people were killed at the hands of state security forces and the ruling partys armed cadres. Hasina, who fled Bangladesh on the afternoon of 5 August 2024, after the countrys chief of army staff told her that it could not guarantee her safety, is currently in exile in India. She has ignored formal requests for her to return. Her former home minister, Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, is also tried in absentia since, like Hasina, he escaped Bangladesh. The only accused present in the dock is the former inspector general of police (IGP), Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who prior to the start of the trial gave a confessional statement to a magistrate and agreed to provide evidence against his co-accused which could allow him to receive a reduced sentence. So far, 23 witnesses called by the prosecution have given evidence. Most of them were themselves shot by law enforcement authorities, while other witnesses are family members of those killed by shooting, or medical staff. Innocent and unarmed student-protestors targeted The prosecution will prove before this tribunal that in July and August 2024, the ruling Awami League government, with the aim of suppressing and persecuting peaceful student-peoples movements and political dissidents, targeted innocent and unarmed student-protestors who were participating in the anti-discrimination student movement, the chief prosecutor, Tajul Islam, said in his opening statement in a court full of lawyers and journalists. Islam used to be a leading member of the Jamaat-e-Islami partys legal defence team when its leaders, a decade earlier, stood trial before the ICT for war crimes during the countrys 1971 war of independence. While pursuing his opening statement, now as chief prosecutor, Islam said the former Awami League government carried out various forms of attacks, persecution, repressive policies, mass arrests, legal harassment, threats, and violence. A coordinated institutional repressive policy was deployed with the cooperation of state security and intelligence agencies, he said, including the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence, the National Security Intelligence, the Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime, and the Special Branch. Protestors were identified with drones, phone tapping, location tracking technology, and repressive measures were taken, Islam added. Simultaneously, the Awami League and its affiliated organizations, the Chhatra League and the Jubo League [the student and youth wings of the Awami League], deployed armed cadres at the local level to identify protestors. Based on this intelligence, law enforcement agencies, especially the police and Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), carried out crackdowns, arrests, and violent attacks. Islam argued that all these programs were executed under the direct orders of the then autocratic prime minister Sheikh Hasina and through the oversight of the then road transport and bridges minister Obaidul Quader, the then home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, and the then IGP Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, and other political leaders, administrative officials, their subordinate officers, and security forces. Obaidul Quader, who has not been arrested and is also believed to be in India, is not a defendant in this trial, but he is accused in another ICT case. Widespread, systematic, and deliberately planned attacks The chief prosecutor said the prosecution will focus on 11 symbolic incidents which, he said, had been selected to prove each element of crimes against humanity as recognized under international law. Through these incidents, the prosecution will demonstrate that the attacks on the civilian population were widespread, systematic, and deliberately planned, he told the ICT. Each incident will serve as a lens through which the tribunal can see how crimes such as murder, persecution, torture, arbitrary detention, and sexual violence were systematically and extensively committed using the entire state apparatus. The chief prosecutor stated that the central strength of the prosecutions case is the irrefutable power of direct evidence, including the former prime ministers own recorded statements, recorded audio, and various clear directives she issued during those calamitous days. Islam pointed out that this was not circumstantial evidence, but undeniable and direct proof that opens a rare and secret window into the intent and planning at the highest levels of government. The evidence that will be presented before this tribunal is not a collection of disjointed pieces of ambiguous information, but an unbroken and solid chain of evidence, where each part strengthens the next. The totality of this evidence - eyewitness testimony, digital records, government communications, and forensic reports - is so clear and powerful that there can be no room for any doubt. This unequivocal and irrefutable evidence will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt the crimes of Sheikh Hasina and the culpability of her co-accused. As an illustration, the chief prosecutor quoted a recorded phone conversation between Hasina and her nephew, Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, the former mayor of South Dhaka, where she says she ordered the RAB to open fire: Ive already given the instruction, this is the standing instruction now, they are to use lethal weapons now. Wherever [they] encounter [them], [they] will shoot immediately. Hasina, the central figure of all crimes According to the chief prosecutor, the three accused, from their positions of highest authority, through a joint criminal enterprise and command responsibility, directed their subordinate forces and the armed cadres of their party to carry out deadly attacks across the country. Islam stated that as an autocratic ruler, the former prime minister Hasina single-handedly made all important decisions. Her subordinate officials were always eager to implement her orders, both politically and administratively, he said. The sole purpose of the crimes against humanity committed during the July movement was to keep Sheikh Hasina in power. She was the central figure or nucleus of all these crimes. The other accused, serving under her, understood that their security and rewards depended on Sheikh Hasina remaining in power, he claimed, adding that the former home minister had full control over the countrys law enforcement agencies and that all decisions regarding the suppression of the movement were made in the Core Committee meetings held at his Dhanmondi residence. But the chief prosecutors words and arguments cannot be heard by Hasina as the former prime minister is not present in the dock for her own ICT trial. In absentia trials are allowed under Bangladesh law but most international tribunals do not allow such proceedings, and many consider them controversial. In his opening statement, Islam defended the in absentia proceedings stating that the absence of the former ministers cannot and will not be a barrier to ensuring accountability for the crimes. He said that the Hasina and Kamal have repeatedly remained absent, failing to surrender to the jurisdiction of the court and that the wilful absconding of the accused or the inaction of any foreign state cannot obstruct this tribunals pursuit of truth and its solemn duty to ensure justice. The arm of justice is long, absence or indifference cannot stop it, he concluded. My eyes, nose and face were hit The first witness to give evidence was 23-year-old driver Khokon Chandra Barman who has had a significant part of his face blown off by gunfire. On 5 August 2024, he had been marching with other protestors towards Dhaka and they arrived in the Jatrabari neighbourhood in the capital city just after midday. He said that he saw a BGB [Border Guard of Bangladesh] shoot a person. He was bleeding as if a cow have been slaughtered. That bullet went out of this persons body and hit another person who was injured as well. Barman said that the crowd then heard news that Hasina had resigned, but after army officials left the area, police officers came out of a police station and started targeting and shooting at us. At one point, he said, he took shelter behind an obstacle under the elevated roadway. There a policemen noticed me and shot at me, targeting my head: my eyes, nose and face were hit, he said. The prosecution then showed a video of Barman, lying in the road, beckoning with his arms, moments after he was shot. Amongst the 23 witnesses who have so far testified, a doctor at the national institute of neurosciences and hospital told the court that during the protests, 167 severely injured people were admitted into the hospital, many shot in the head. He added that on 19 July 2024, members of the detective branch of the police, warned him not to provide treatment to gunshot victims and not to admit any further injured patients. Detective branch personnel warned: Do not be overzealous. You will get into trouble. Do not release those already admitted. There are instructions from above, and legal action will be taken against them, he said. The Awami Leagues response to the trial The court has appointed Amir Hossain, a seasoned criminal lawyer, as the state defence counsel to represent both Hasina and Kamal. He received the evidence relied on by the prosecution on 25 June 2025, five weeks before the first day of the trial. When he was asked whether five weeks were sufficient time to prepare, he said, when I need an adjournment, I will ask for one.","url":"https://www.justiceinfo.net/en/149180-bangladesh-hasina-trial-begins.html"}

But one significant question has emerged - will it have any effect on the former ruling Awami League party, which Hasina still heads - and what does it mean for her future in politics, if any? The Bangladesh government has for months been calling for Hasina, who currently resides in India, to be extradited. A previous extradition plea was for a lesser sentence for contempt of court, which India did not respond to. But if an elected government comes to power following the scheduled Bangladesh national elections in February next year and pushes for her extradition, or puts pressure to stop her from carrying on party activities from there, it could make it more difficult for India to ignore such a request from an elected government. Even before the verdict, a court had imposed a ban on media outlets publishing what it termed her 'provocative statements' - a move condemned by her party, the Awami League. The interim government has also banned the party's activities by executive order. Since the ouster of its government, the Awami League has been largely invisible from politics on the ground. All its top leaders are in exile, many of them in India, while others have been arrested. Any further restrictions on Hasinas statements or the Awami Leagues operations following this verdict would place the party under considerable pressure. While the party maintains there is no internal debate over her leadership, it remains to be seen whether mounting legal restrictions, coupled with increased diplomatic pressure on India for her return, will compel the Awami League to adopt a different strategy in the days ahead.

{"doc_id":"2a9f3e65e0b8c577","title":"Bangladesh tribunal sentences Sheikh Hasina to death : NPR","content":"Bangladesh's ousted prime minister sentenced to death for role in protest crackdown A court in Bangladesh sentenced ousted Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death for crimes against humanity on Monday, for her role in a crackdown on last year's student-led uprising which the United Nations says left up to 1,400 people dead. The country's International Crimes Tribunal, a domestic war crimes court in the capital Dhaka, also sentenced Hasina's home minister, Asaduzzaman Khan, to death. A three-member tribunal announced the ruling in a session that was broadcast live and lasted several hours. Hasina and Khan fled to India in August last year and were sentenced in absentia. A third suspect, a former police chief, was sentenced to five years in prison after becoming a state witness against Hasina and pleading guilty to crimes against humanity. The ICT was set up in 2009 to investigate and prosecute those accused of war crimes during Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. At the time of its creation, it was accused by Human Rights Watch and other groups of not meeting international standards. On Monday, HRW's South Asia deputy director Meenakshi Ganguly posted on social media: \"Bangladesh should ensure a credible justice system, abolish capital punishment.\" Chief Prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam insists that Hasina who was found guilty, among other charges, of ordering the use of lethal force by her security services received a fair trial. \"Our tribunal was developed in line with the Nuremberg trials. It has met all international standards. No one can point to anywhere where those standards have not been met,\" he told NPR. \"Their defense lawyer was given enough time to come up with the response. He could not take instruction from the accused as they are fugitives. If they had been present, they could have given their testimonies and provided further witnesses, and they would have been given further time as per the law.\" Hasina, 78, denounced the verdict as biased and politically motivated. She released a statement through a public relations firm, saying: \"The verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate. I wholly deny the accusations that have been made against me in the ICT. I mourn all of the deaths that occurred in July and August of last year, on both sides of the political divide. But neither I nor other political leaders ordered the killing of protestors. I was given no fair chance to defend myself in court, nor even to have lawyers of my own choice represent me in absentia.\" Pent-up grievance about corruption in the government prompted the protesters many of them young people to revolt. The uprising started in July 2024, with demands to abolish government job allocations. It later morphed into a wider anti-government movement and ended with Hasina resigning her post after 15 years in power and fleeing in a helicopter. Monday's verdict comes as the country continues to grapple with instability and violence, with tensions mounting in the days ahead of the ruling. The interim government, led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, stepped up security, with paramilitary border guards and police deployed in Dhaka and many other parts of the country, and soldiers surrounding the tribunal premises. Experts believe the verdict will likely reignite the cycle of violence that has come to characterize Bangladeshi politics. Naomi Hossain, a development studies professor at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies told NPR: \"After the uprising, we might have had a process of justice and peace and reconciliation. We've had the same as before. We call it accountability, but it's more like political revenge.\" She added: \"What really matters is, many people think that this is a kind of justice and that no other kind of justice was going to be achieved.\" Yunus has banned the activities of Hasina's Awami League party ahead of elections set for February. In a statement following the verdict, Bangladesh's Ministry of Home Affairs urged India to extradite both Hasina and Khan soon. India's Foreign Ministry in a statement acknowledged the tribunal's verdict but fell short of stating whether it would hand them over to Dhaka. Hasina cannot appeal the verdict unless she returns to Bangladesh a move that could further ignite the country's political turmoil.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/17/g-s1-98112/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-verdict"}
{"doc_id":"2d21aaff01b316a5","title":"Ousted Bangladesh PM Charged With Protest Killings | OCCRP","content":"Reported by A Bangladeshi court has formally charged ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina with crimes against humanity over the deaths of more than 1,000 protesters during last years mass demonstrations that ended her 15-year rule. At the opening of the trial on Sunday, Bangladeshs International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) accepted allegations that Hasina incited, encouraged and ordered a nationwide police crackdown that killed at least 1,500 people and injured more than 25,000, according to chief prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam. Based on evidence and witness testimony, Hasinas systematic and widespread attacks against innocent, unarmed students and civilians amount to crimes against humanity, Tajul Islam said in his opening remarks. The court issued arrest warrants for the 77-year-old former prime minister, who has been living in India as a fugitive since her ouster in August 2024. Hasina is scheduled to appear in court on June 16 alongside former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and former police chief Chowdhury Mamun. All three face five charges related to crimes against humanity, including incitement, complicity, facilitation, conspiracy and failure to prevent mass murder, for their alleged roles in the violent suppression of the protests. Bangladesh requested Hasinas extradition from India in December, but has not yet received a formal response. The arrest warrants come 10 months after Hasina fled Bangladesh following weeks of escalating protests that began in June 2024. What started as peaceful student-led demonstrations against a discriminatory civil service quota system quickly turned deadly. estimates, more than 1,400 people were killed between July 1 and August 15, 2024, in what the U.N. Human Rights Office described as a government-ordered crackdown. Nearly 13 percent of those killed were children, the office said. The brutal response was a calculated and well-coordinated strategy by the former Government to hold onto power in the face of mass opposition, U.N. Human Rights Chief Volker Trk said. Hasina, the countrys longest-serving leader and daughter of Bangladeshs founding president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, served as prime minister from 1996 to 2001 and again from 2009 until her removal last year. Her government has long faced accusations of enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, media suppression and widespread corruption. Estimates of public money lost to corruption under her administration reportedly range from $17 billion to $30 billion. The blatant theft of public funds fuelled outrage in a country where nearly 19 percent of its 173 million people live in poverty, according to the World Bank. The first trial stemming from the crackdown began on May 25, when eight police officers were charged with killing six protesters on August 5, 2024the same day Hasina fled the country. The ICT was originally established in 2010 during Hasinas tenure to try war crimes suspects from Bangladeshs 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.","url":"https://www.occrp.org/en/news/ousted-bangladesh-pm-charged-with-protest-killings"}
{"doc_id":"8a172a9431a51e94","title":"An Over-Analysis Of When People Say \"How's It Going?\", \"What's Up?\" or \"What's New?\" | www.succeedsocially.com","content":"An Over-Analysis Of When People Say \"How's It Going?\", \"What's Up?\" or \"What's New?\" I know some of you ruefully laughed when you saw the title of this one. I don't think anyone is horribly bitter about it, but the common, occasionally awkward, exchange of, \"How's it going?\" - \"Good. How are you?\" - \"Good\" is a special pet peeve of many people. Some of us have devoted a little too much mental energy to questions like, \"Why does everyone ask you how you are if they don't really want to know?\", or \"What's the point in asking someone what's new if they always just say 'nothing much'?\" So with that in mind, I'm going to write an entire article about the topic, because I really do have enough to say that I can do that. The purposes of asking \"How's it going?\", \"What's new?\", etc. As you probably already know, these phrases have two uses: - As a standard greeting. The whole, How are you? - Good. You? - Good exchange is just another way of saying hi - As a generic way to start a conversation, usually when we haven't talked to someone in a bit Both uses have their qualities that people find a tad annoying. There's also the rich, confusing ground that pops up when we aren't sure how the other person is using the terms - Are they saying, \"What's new?\" because they want to chat, or are they just saying hello? Using \"What's up?\" as a greeting Asking how someone is and the reply of, \"Good. How are you?\" has become a kind of ritualized greeting. It's a longer, more detailed way of saying hello. Not only are you saying hi, but you're also being a little more friendly and asking how they are. In one sense the words are rote and empty, but in another way you're still showing you an interest in the other person. Another way I always thought of it is, if you see a co-worker coming down the hall, simply saying 'hey' doesn't take up enough time. You'd greet them when they were fifteen feet away or so, then be left with a silence while you finished passing each other. The What's Up? Good exchange fills that dead air. The right response in these situations is to just be friendly and go through the routine. Over thinking it will drive you mad. It doesn't really matter that everyone says they're \"fine\", even if they may not be. It's okay that people technically ask each other how they are, even though that's not what they really mean. It's just part of how it works. \"What's going on?\" as a conversation starter If you're visiting your parents and my dad asks you what's new, he obviously actually wants to know how you're doing and if anything really is new with you. It's about the most basic, all-purpose way to kick off a conversation there is. Hopefully the answer will provide enough material to start the real discussion. It's unoriginal enough that we can get tired of hearing it, but it works okay. As you can probably guess, the best response if you're asked \"What's up?\" in this way is to give some kind of answer that will give them something to work with and get a conversation going. You could say how you actually are, but in a fleshed out way, or you could quickly say you're doing okay and then ask them some sort of question which will also hopefully let the true conversation begin (e.g., \"I'm good. How was your vacation to South Africa?\") It can be hard to think of what to say right away. That's one main reason these phrases often lead to little awkward moments. People will often initially respond to, \"How are you?\" with something like , \"I'm good. yeah, things are okay.\" to buy themselves time to come up with a better response. I think everyone feels a little caught off guard and on the spot to come up with a fascinating answer sometimes. Nothing unusual at all about taking a few seconds to gather your thoughts. Don't worry if you don't always have a great answer to the literal \"How are you?\" question. Often we're really not up to much or not a lot is new. The point is to get someone talking, and as long as that happens then everything is fine. Plus if someone really does want to know what's new in your life, saying \"Not much\" and then changing the topic technically did answer the question. The confusing middle ground I think what drives people mental over \"How are you doing?\" is that there are lots of cases where they're not sure how the other person means it. Here's a sample of the questions and concerns that can rush through your head when you're hit with a \"What's up?\": - \"Are they saying 'How are you doing?' to say hello or because they actually want to talk?.\" - \"If they just wanted to say hi, then I don't want to try to start a conversation.\" - \"But if they do want to chat, then I don't want to just go 'fine' and walk away.\" - \"If they do want to talk, do they truly want to hear how I am, or do they not particularly care and were just using that line to initiate the conversation?\" I'm sure you've had those moments where you do the standard How are you? - Good exchange with a colleague, then you both awkwardly hesitate for a beat because you're not sure whether you should say more or not. Another thing that happens fairly often is someone will say, \"How's it going?\", hoping to start a conversation. The other person will say, \"Good. How are you?\", but not because they're doing the greeting version, but because they can't think of anything to say. The first person will then respond, \"I'm good too.\" Then there will be this confused moment hanging in the air before the conversation peters out. By the halfway point of the back and forth neither side knew whether they were playing out a Greeting or a Conversation Starter, and once the exchange was over they were paralyzed and not sure how to go forward. This can all leave you baffled. Thankfully getting your wires crossed with someone doesn't really hurt you. So you passed a classmate on campus and they wanted to talk, and you just greeted them and went on? No big deal, you still said hello. It's not like you humiliated yourself or anything. If the same thing happened to you, you'd understand. Or they wanted to talk and you couldn't come up with a response and fell into an accidental greeting? Just take a second to think of something to say and re-initiate the conversation. Overall, don't over-analyze things or worry about it too much. It gets easier to handle these situations when you realize it's fine if you sometimes get them wrong. Other reasons some people may be put off by \"How's it going?\" There are a few reasons more socially awkward people may cringe at the thought of getting asked \"What's going on?\", when it's used as a conversation starter: They feel like they have to give an interesting response, even though they often don't have one They may think that if someone asks them what's new, that they to have a captivating answer every time. Also, if someone doesn't have much of a social life, they may really not have much going on, and worry they'll look boring and dorky for hardly ever having a good response. As I just said, the point is to say hello or kick off a conversation and the actual answer to the \"What's going on?\" starter question only sometimes matters. Another funny thing is that if given enough time, almost everyone's usual answer to, \"What's new?\" becomes boring after a while. So don't get too worried if you always feel like you're giving the same old reply. When you've known someone long enough, whatever they typically say becomes the equivalent to \"Not much.\", no matter how exciting or impressive their lives may have seemed to you at first. The traveler visited yet another country. The outdoorsy friend went camping again. The artsy person put on another play or had another exhibition. The party animal had another rowdy weekend of drinking. Of course, if you do feel bad for not having a life, you should still try to fix it. But not having a sparkling come back to \"What's new?\" shouldn't the main thing you lose sleep over. They feel like people are grilling them Some socially inexperienced people are defensive and secretive, because they want to hide parts of their lives, such as not having a ton of friends. When people ask them how they are, the insecure, mildly suspicious part of them feels like they're being interrogated. They may even think people are asking them \"What's up?\" in a mocking way, so they can chuckle over their pathetic answer. They may leave everyone feeling a bit puzzled when they always seem to clam up whenever someone asks them how they are. When people ask how you are, you can sometimes just say, \"Nothing new really\" and change the topic. However, you can't swing too far the other way and never reveal any personal information about yourself. Sometimes they do want to know, and not giving them anything will make them wonder. You can at share some more superficial details. Disliking \"What's up?\" because of the awkwardness it can be associated with There's no doubt \"How are you?\" can be at the center of some forced, uncomfortable interactions, especially when you don't feel like you have your social act together on the whole. You can come to dislike the phrases because of the situations they get linked to. One example is when you see someone around all the time, but for whatever reason you always struggle to make conversation with them. This happens a lot with co-workers or acquaintances you don't have a ton in common with. In these cases you always seem to go through the whole greeting thing and it always feels really perfunctory and awkward. You know you should be saying more to them, but the words escape you. Every \"How are you? Good, you?\" just twists the knife. The \"What's new?\" is a more a symptom of the problem, not the cause. How to fix the underlying issue of being able to think of something else to say is for another article.","url":"https://www.succeedsocially.com/howareyou"}

It is a book that is far superior to the other texts-including my own. Murray Our one-on-one talks with students during writing workshop offer us perfect opportunities to zero in on what each student needs as a writer. As Lead Staff Developer for the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project, Carl Anderson has provided hundreds of teachers with the information and confidence they need to make these complex conferences an effective part of classroom practice. Finally, in Hows It Going?, Anderson shares his expertise with the rest of us. For Anderson, the key to a powerful writing conference lies in understanding that it is a conversation with a clear purpose and a predictable structure. This is the best lens through which to view the task of talking about writing. To that end, Anderson shows how we can take what we already know about having effective conversations and use that knowledge. Sample transcripts of conferences with elementary and middle school students in both urban and suburban settings walk us through the process step by step, providing new insight into how ambitious conferences unfold. Above all, Hows It Going? is a practical book. Written in a conversational style, its filled with lots of useful advice, including an in-depth discussion of the teachers role in conferences, strategies for teaching students to take an active role, ways to weave in literature, minilessons, classroom management strategies, and responses to the most frequently asked questions about conferring. Along the way, readers will learn new ways of thinking, develop effective techniques, and perfect straightforward strategies.
