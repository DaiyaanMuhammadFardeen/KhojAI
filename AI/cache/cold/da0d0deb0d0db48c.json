I usually wear either a yellow shirt, a tan one or an ecru shade with a darker brown suit, but this blue is also very pleasing. Any of these colors, in my opinion, is better than stark white which, I find, to sometimes be a little too 'harsh' when paired with brown. You mentioned a slightly shorter jacket, and this is certainly flattering if one is on the short/regular borderline as you mention. However, if one is a definite long, you have to be a bit careful not to wear something too short so that it doesn't look as if you have outgrown the things you are wearing. What really 'seals' this outfit as a winner is the amazing balmoral boot. I just love them, and I am quite sure that you have the identical item in black.* I have some boots from Johnston and Murphy and also from Paul Fredrick, but I had to settle for a blucker style, not the more formal closed bottom like in this boot. I am sure that these, being from PS, were far more expensive than mine. Even as it is, I get compliments on the ones I have because, being in academia and in science, I am perhaps in even more of a sartorial deset than you are. * I likely have dozens of things in which I have purchased the same item in various colors: suits, pants, shoes, , sweaters, even overcoats. I like basic styles and, once I find one I like, I enjoy getting it in various colors.\" I, as you do, do not like white shirts with brown suits, finding that white does little to complement most brown suits, making a better contrast with navy or grey suits. At 6' 1\", you are clearly in the \"long\" category, whereas I am now 5' 8\" (I seem to have shrunk an inch in the last few years) and am now a borderline short suit wearer - depending on make and model. I do make sure that my suit jackets cover my ass, and ideally, the hem falls at the first joint of my thumb. As for balmoral boots, I have a pair in black, which I am wearing today, and would have posted to this thread, save for the fact that my ISP decided to take a powder sometime overnight, and is not scheduled to be back online until sometime this evening. I will post photos of today's attire as soon as I am able, Verizon willing. For the record, my black balmoral boots, though also from Paul Stuart, are not exactly the same as my brown ones, due to the fact that both were bought on sale - beggars can't be choosers. I am told that academia is a sartorial desert, and my office, if not a total sartorial desert, is definitely at least a sartorial savannah - close to desert conditions. I am, I believe, the local oasis .",
